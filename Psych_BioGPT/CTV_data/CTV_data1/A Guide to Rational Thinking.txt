THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove thinking allowed 

00:00:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Hello, and welcome. I'm Jeffrey Mishlove. Today we're going to be examining philosophy and psychotherapy. We'll be looking at how our behavior, our emotions, are affected by our ideas. With me is Dr. Albert Ellis, one of the most influential psychologists in the history of psychology. Dr. Ellis is the author of over 60 books and 600 academic papers. He originally began his career as a sexologist and, as the author of books such as the Art and Science and, of Love and Sex Without Guilt, is considered one of the fathers of the sexual revolution of the 1960s. In addition, he is considered the grandfather of cognitive behavior therapy, perhaps the most influential psychotherapeutic movement today, and the founder of rational-emotive therapy. Welcome, Dr. Ellis. 

00:01:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Good to be here, Jeff. 

00:01:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD It's a pleasure to be with you. You are probably most widely noted for introducing into the field of psychotherapy an idea that seems almost self-evident, which is that our behavior, our, our being, ourselves are affected by our philosophies, by what we think. 

00:01:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and also, conversely, I introduced many years ago, when I first formed RET, Rational-Emotive Therapy, the idea that our thinking is also affected by our behavior and our feelings. 

00:01:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hmm. So, in effect, it's all one system. 

00:01:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right, interactional. 

00:01:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hmm. And that system can therefore, obviously be affected by dealing with any, any part of it, I would assume; behavior, emotions, or cognition, or thoughts. 

00:02:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PhD Psychotherapist 

00:02:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, but profoundly, if you profoundly change your philosophy, your thinking, then you're more likely, in all probability, to profoundly change your feeling and your behavior, especially your disturbed feeling and your disturbed behavior. 

00:02:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Uh-huh. And you drew on the ancient philosophers, and sort of, coming to the notion that philosophy itself could be a form of psychotherapy and at that point, you broke away from psychoanalysis, and developed a form of cognitive therapy. 

00:02:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yes, I practiced and was a psychoanalyst for a while, but then I discovered that it didn't work, and I have a gene for efficiency, while poor Sigmund Freud had a gene for inefficiency. So, I went back to my hobby since the age of 16: philosophy, the philosophy of the ancients, largely of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, and in the East, of Confucius, Lao Tzu, and Buddha, and amalgamated it with behavior therapy, which I had used on myself at the age of 19 to get myself over my phobia of public speaking, and of approaching young females. 

00:03:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hmm. Well, well if I could get to the kernel of, of your thought it is basically that whatever happens to us in life, it's not totally responsible for our emotions. 

00:03:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, it partly, it contributes to it. A, activating events, contribute to C, consequences in our gut, but it's B, our belief system, our philosophy, which mainly, largely, or certainly in great part, makes us feel and think the way we do, especially think, and I should say behave the way we do, especially in a disturbed manner. We disturb ourselves. 

00:03:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And typically, I suppose, when a person is very angry, or very depressed, they almost always think that it's something outside that causing that. 

00:03:55
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and we normally, and I think biologically, tend to think that because C, consequences, my anger immediately follows your treating me unfairly, that you made me angry instead of you made me feel sorry and regretful to some degree, but my anger I added by commanding and demanding that you not do what you indubitably did. 

00:04:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Uh-huh, and in a sense, if I'm right, you broke with Freud in suggesting that the parents aren't responsible, early upbringing isn't responsible, that we teach ourselves the, these kinds of neurotic, uh, behaviors. 

00:04:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, we're born gullible to our parents; influenceable, teachable, in the first place, therefore we stupidly listen to our parents, but then we invent many musts, shoulds, oughts, demands, commands in addition to the standards, the values, that we adopt from our parents, but the standards don't upset us. We mainly upset ourselves with those Jehovian commands. 

00:05:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD You use the term, I think you must have coined it, musterbation. 

00:05:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, that, masturbation is good and delicious, but musterbation is evil and pernicious is one of my sayings. 

00:05:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And, and musterbation is, is when we tell ourselves, I must do this or things must be this way, even though they are not. 

00:05:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, the three main musts are I must do well, or I'm no good; you, you louse, must treat me well, or you're worthless and deserve to roast in hell; and the world must give me exactly what I want, precisely when I want it, or it's a horrible, awful place. 

00:05:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD It would be awful. 

00:05:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD It would be terrible, right, because of the musts. If you didn't musterbate, then you wouldn't awfulize, terrible-ize, catastrophize, say, "I can't stand it!" and put yourself down. If you only stuck with, "I'd like very much to do well, but I never have to," then you wouldn't then disturb yourself. 

00:06:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD So, the technique that you get engaged in with your clients, and uh, is one of disputing their, their musts, their ideas, and showing them that logically, scientifically, philosophically things are not that way. That, that nothing must be if it isn't. 

00:06:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD The technique is the scientific method, and we say we're the only cognitive behavioral therapy to which does say that when you think anti-scientifically, devoutly, really piously, dogmatically, which is inflexible anti-scientific, then you disturb yourself. Therefore, we use the flexible scientific method to get you philosophically, and otherwise, to un-disturb yourself. 

00:06:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. Now, many people, I think particularly the Freudian school of therapy, would, would suggest, um, that, that simply being told by your therapist that you're thinking things wrong isn't going to make a bit of difference. That you'll continue with the same old behaviors anyway. 

00:07:00
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD And we would agree. That being told it, or being told where you got it, which you didn't get it from your sacred mother and father, won't help you, but the insight that I made myself disturbed, I foolishly listened to my mother and father, and took them too seriously, and I'm still doing it, and that now I require work and practice, work and practice to give up my biological and sociological tendency to disturb myself. That will help you, not the belief that I disturbed myself, and that I don't have to. That'll help, but not that much. 

00:07:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Yeah. Well, doesn't the idea that if you can simply change your philosophy that your whole behavior will change somehow go against, oh the, uh, the behaviorist concept, or the materialist notion that the, the mind doesn't really influence matter? In effect, you're saying that our mind will influence. 

00:07:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Very significantly, but we also say that since you practiced, worked at this, foolish philosophy, ingrained it in yourself, conditioned yourself, that therefore, it requires work and practice to give it up, and it requires feeling against it. So, we always use cognitive thinking, and emotive-dramatic-evocative, and behavioral techniques to get people comprehensively to change, and to stay changed. 

00:08:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD In effect, what you say is that every emotional state has its concomitant belief system. 

00:08:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, that even sorrow and regret, which would be appropriate emotions when you're not getting what you want, have the belief system it's too bad, isn't it bad, isn't it unfortunate, while horror and depression has it's awful, and it must not be this way, and I can't bear it. So, and each of the negative, self-defeating say, such as depression, or anxiety, or despair, or rage, has some individual difference in what you tell yourself, what you believe philosophically. 

00:09:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD So, in a sense, the heart of your philosophical approach then is to distinguish between what we might call appropriate philosophies, appropriate emotions, and inappropriate ones. 

00:09:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PhD Psychotherapist 

00:09:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD And, oddly enough, I discovered, after years of doing rational-emotive therapy, RET, that there only are a few differences, and one main difference, and it's crucial, is taking a preference, a desire, a goal, a value, practically all of which are legitimate, and escalating it again. Transmuting it into a demand, a should, an ought, a must, an absolute. 

00:09:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD In other words, the most terrible thing could happen to me. Perhaps, I have leprosy. 

00:09:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:09:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Or, or some kind of a fatal disease, or I think, as you pointed out, maybe somebody is slowly torturing me to death. 

00:09:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:09:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And that doesn't necessarily justify me going into a state of a depression. 

00:09:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Or of horror! 

00:09:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Or of horror. 

00:09:55
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD But it does justify you saying, "I don't like this. I wish it weren't so. What am I gonna do about it?" which you won't do if you're horrified. You'll freeze, and make yourself worse. So, you control largely, not completely, your emotional destiny, and your behavioral destiny, and if you change your basic philosophy of life, then you can change it. You have the power to do so, but you normally sit on your rump, and don't use that power. 

00:10:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PhD 

00:10:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, how, how would you distinguish your approach, say from Norman Vincent Peale, The Power of Positive Thinking? 

00:10:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, that is a good one, in a limited way, because it says, instead of I can't do well, I can hit the tennis ball better, and it helps you perform better, but underlyingly, it's still a philosophy, and I have to, and if I don't hit that damn tennis ball well there's something rotten about me as a tennis player, and a person. So we undermine the negative thinking, and don't just cover it up, which will help to some degree with positive, and often Pollyanna-ish, thinking - day by day, in every way, I'm getting better and better, Coue - but he went out of business 'cause people fell on their face and didn't get better day by day. 

00:11:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD In effect, I guess, what you're saying is things may or may not get better. They may even get worse, but they don't have to get awful. 

00:11:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and one of the techniques in RET is to show you that you can do better, which is positive thinking, but if you don't, you don't. And even at the very worst, where you sometimes implode what you may do, or may happen to you, at the worst, show you that you don't have to be miserable. My book, which is just coming out now, is called, my new book for the public, is called How to Stubbornly Refuse to Make Yourself Miserable About Anything: Yes Anything! 

00:11:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD That's quite a title. Well, you just used a technical term, implode. Why don't we elaborate on that? 

00:11:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Implode means to really get into your feeling, or your behavior, and do it many times forcefully, vigorously, feel the worst, feel very upset, and then change it to appropriate negative feelings. We're not against feelings, just against inappropriate, self-defeating feelings, such as sorrow, and regret, and frustration, and annoyance, which will drive you back to A, activating events, bad events in your life, to change them. So we want you to feel. We don't want you to have no feeling, indifference, nirvana, desirelessness, or anything like that, but real feeling. 

00:12:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD In, in a sense, it would seem that when people awfulize, when they make things awful, they're, they're using that almost as a screen to keep from getting in touch with their genuine feelings of disappointment. 

00:12:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right. Their very genuine feeling, their good negative feeling, would be disappointment: I don't like this; what can I do to change it; how bad, how unfortunate, and they miss that with how awful, how horrible, how terrible, and then again they get bad results and sit on their rumps again and do nothing, instead of forcing themselves to go back to the grind and change what you can change, and to accept what you cannot. 

00:12:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD It almost sounds like good old-fashioned American philosophy in, in some way. 

00:13:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, Emerson had some of it, and Thoreau, and some of the American philosophers, and I got it mainly from the original philosophers, and also from their derivatives: from John Dewey, who had a good deal of it; Bertrand Russell, the English philosopher; Karl Popper, the great philosopher of science; and other modern philosophers. 

00:13:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. In, in effect, you're saying if you just live your life more rationally, if you think things through, you'll be saner. 

00:13:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Much saner, but then again you'd better force yourself to do what you're afraid of, and to feel differently. So, again, it's always, RET is always primarily cognitive-philosophic, but very much also emotive-dramatic-evocative, and behavioral-active. 

00:13:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And in your work as a therapist you don't just sit back and calmly philosophize. You, you try and use philosophical approaches that really get inside of a person, to their own inner thoughts, and, and work with them to change those inner thoughts, what they tell themselves. 

00:14:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and we teach them to do it. We have homework, cognitive and behavioral homework, so that they as homework can do most of it themselves. That's why our therapy, rational-emotive therapy, is an intrinsically briefer therapy than almost all the others. That's the way it usually, not always, is. 

00:14:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD But when you're dealing with logic, I mean, you would admit, I know, that most people are irrational much of the time. 

00:14:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Much of the time. 

00:14:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And, and not only do we feel that we have to be a certain way, and that we must do this, and we can't do that, but we also feel bad, uh, if we don't. That is, if, if I'm a little bit upset, then I feel, oh I must not be, so I make it even worse. 

00:14:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yes, the secondary disturbance is worse than the primary. The primary is I must do well and I'm no good if I don't, or you must love me and you're no good if you don't, but the secondary one is my God I feel anxious, I feel depressed, I feel angry, as I must not, as I should not, as I ought not be, and you get anxious about your anxiety, depressed about your depression, guilty about your anger, and then you're really gone. 

00:15:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD (crosstalk) Then you go into a panic state. 

00:15:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right, and then you're not able to really correct the primary. And so, we in RET first get you over your self-downing about your disturbance, then we go back to the original disturbance. Show you how you mainly, largely created it, and how you have the power within you to think differently, act differently, and feel differently, and undo it. 

00:15:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And a, a good deal of the, the philosophical aspects of this, I suppose, has to do with the labels that a person applies to themself: I am a horrible person, or... 

00:15:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PhD Psychotherapist 

00:15:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and we quote general, um, semantics.Alfred Korzybski, a genius, not a therapist, who said, "When we overgeneralize we render ourselves unsane." So, we are against un, overgeneralized thinking, which again is one of the cores of human disturbance. 

00:16:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD So you would spend a lot of time, if a person thinks that they're a horrible person, saying, "Well, maybe you did a horrible thing, but that doesn't mean you're always a horrible person." 

00:16:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and you're never a good person, because if you do a good deed, save a child, for example, from drowning at the risk of your own life, that's a good deed, but ten minutes later you might kill somebody, or steal, or lie. So, you're a person who does good, valuable, self-helping, and bad, unfortunate, self-defeating things. You are not rateable. We teach people and show them how to not rate themselves. They're being only what they do; their performances, their deeds, their acts. 

00:16:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And consequently, I suppose, when they're angry at someone else, not to damn another person, no matter what they do. 

00:16:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. One of the main derivatives of the musts, since you must do well as I think you must, and if you haven't done what you must, you are a totally rotten individual, and you deserve, again, to never get any joy on earth and maybe roast in hell for eternity. So, we are against damnation of you, of other people, and the universe. 

00:17:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD This must involve, in a sense, a, uh, unconditional acceptance of whoever might walk into your office, no matter what they may have done in their lives. 

00:17:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. We and the late Carl Rogers had unconditional positive regard or acceptance for people, but we also teach them, which I'm afraid Carl did not, how to regard themselves. How to teach themselves to always, under all conditions at all times, no matter how badly they act, or who doesn't adore them, to accept themselves, just because they're human, just because they're alive. Period. 

00:17:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PhD 

00:17:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And, I guess that aspect of your work is, is what has caused many people to, to label you profoundly humanistic. 

00:17:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Oh yes, and I am, and I wrote a book. One of my best books, and one of my most popular books, published by McGraw-Hill, is called Humanistic Psychotherapy: The Rational-Emotive Approach, which is a little different from some other so-called humanistic approaches. 

00:18:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. Well, when a person is, is really all worked up, in a state of panic, uh, as, as it were, do you find that disputing with them is, is effective, or, you know, when they're in that heightened aroused state, or are there other techniques that are more appropriate at such a time? 

00:18:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, we have many emotive-evocative techniques. One of them is accepting them ourselves... 

00:18:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:18:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Which is emotive... 

00:18:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Yeah. 

00:18:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD And we have rational-emotive imagery, where we get people to imagine the worst and then feel terrible, and then work on their feeling. We have my famous shame attacking exercise, 'cause shame is the essence of much disturbance, where we get you and other people and our clients to go out and do something asinine, foolish, ridiculous, and not feel ashamed. Now don't get in trouble, don't walk naked in the streets or anything like that, but yell out the stops, if you're civilized enough in your city to have a subway, like we're civilized enough in New York, and stop somebody on the street and say, "I just got out of the loony bin. What month is it?" and not feel ashamed when they look in horror at you and think you're off your rocker, which they think you are, but you're really not. You're being very much saner than they are. 

00:19:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD In, in other words, it's almost the opposite of positive thinking. You have people really confront their greatest fear. 

00:19:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:19:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And then in, in the middle of the thing that they thought would be the most awful thing that could ever happen to them, they learn that at least it's not totally awful. That there must be something redeeming about it. 

00:19:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and I got this partly because at the age of 19 I was scared witless of public speaking and approaching young females, and I made myself in-vivo, alive, uncomfortably speak in public, till I got over my fear, and now you can't keep me away from the public speaking platform, and approaching those females. And I approached a hundred of them, and I only got one date, and she didn't show up, but I saw cognitively that nothing terrible happened, and I got over my fear of approaching women. So we get people to act against their nutty philosophies. 

00:20:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Uh-huh. It's, it's if, in a sense, when a person thinks that things are hopeless, if you can use your approach to show them one tiny little ray of light, that that's an improvement for them. 

00:20:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right. When you say, "I can't stand it," you mean, "I'll die of it," which you won't, or that, "I can't be happy at all if you reject me, or I fail an examination." We show you can be happy at all. You can often be very happy, despite the failure, despite the rejection, and therefore nothing is really that hopeless. 

00:20:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. Now, one of the techniques that I see in your work that strikes me as, as quite interesting, and a little unfamiliar to me personally, is the use of sarcasm. 

00:20:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PhD Psychotherapist 

00:20:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, we use humor. We're sarcastic about your ideas if you're upset, because when you're un-humorous you take things too seriously, and we reduce your ideas to absurdity, but we never laugh at you, only the way you think and act and feel, and we show you how to laugh at yourself and not to take yourself too seriously, which is what emotional disturbance, again, is. 

00:21:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And you, you've even written a whole series of, uh, little songs that, that you teach people to sing, to sort of sarcastically laugh at their own ideas. 

00:21:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, rational, humorous songs to show them that they can look at themselves, and what they do, and laugh at it, and not upset themselves about it, even when they fail. 

00:21:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. Now, I suppose the interesting thing, um, about your work, as a, as a whole body of work, is that in, in today's day and age psychotherapy in general is controversial. Scientists question whether any form of therapy works, but there's quite a bit of research that suggests that these approaches that you've developed are effective with specific problems. 

00:21:55
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD We have about 250 studies of our therapy, mainly RET, but also of what is called cognitive therapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy, that shows when you get people to basically change their irrational thinking, they become significantly improved. Almost all those 250, about 80% or 90%, do. Then we have another 250 studies or so which show that what I call irrational ideas. You must do well, and it's terrible when you don't. Wwhen you endorse more of those, you're more disturbed, and the people who are psychologically and psychiatrically disturbed do endorse more of them, so they look like they're valid. These are experiments. They're not clinical studies, which are always prejudiced by the therapist, but these are objective... 

00:22:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:22:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Studies. 

00:22:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PhD 

00:22:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD I mean, some of the, uh, reports go rather far, in terms of being able, for example, to help a person get rid of a, a physiological addiction, like cocaine or alcohol, by working, uh, through the cognitive processes that they have. 

00:22:55
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yes, cognitively and behaviorally. 

00:23:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:23:00
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD We, and especially in the San Francisco area, have Dr. Emmett Belton, who's very good at this, and many of us are, and we have a new book on the rational-emotive treatment of alcoholism and substance abuse, by myself and some of my collaborators, and we show people that they don't have to get themselves anxious, and when they're anxious they don't have to run for the bottle or the coke or the methadone or whatever they use when they're anxious, and they don't have to put themselves down for being alcoholic or drug addicts. We show them all those things, and if they change their basic attitude, and then push themselves to not take the substances, then they can overcome it, and stay overcome. 

00:23:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD In other words, you, you get at the belief system that they must have, that it would be awful if they don't continue with their, uh, addiction. 

00:23:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right, because that's low frustration tolerance. The two main things that upset people are: one, I have to do well and be approved, and I'm no good; but, two, things must be easy, and my anxiety or my despair or my depression must not exist, must not exist. I can't stand it, so I'll cop out by taking the alcohol or the drugs. We show'em they can stay with the anxiety, define it as a pain in the neck, and not as awful, as horrible, and then work using RET to give it up. 

00:24:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm, but when a person's belief system is that they have to, I have to have this drug, and they say, "Well, physiologically it's a disease." 

00:24:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:24:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD "I know I'm addicted." how do you logically dispute that? 

00:24:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, the answer is that some people,alcoholics, for example, do have a gene for alcoholism, so they find it most difficult to drink one drink and not finish the bottle, and, but they don't have to drink even one drink, and when they're anxious or depressed or anything, they can say, "Too bad. Tough. That's the way I am. I don't have to cover it up or drink to feel better. I'm going to get better by facing my pain and then working through it." which, again, RET specializes in showing them how to do. 

00:25:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD In a sense, it's, it's very much influenced, I think, by the Stoic philosophers in, in terms of showing people how to lump life. 

00:25:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PhD Psychotherapist 

00:25:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. You, and the St. Francis philosophy, and Reinhold Niebuhr, and Alcoholics Anonymous: Give me the courage to change what I can change, the serenity to accept what I cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference between the two. That's one of the precepts of RET, which we got mainly from the ancient philosophers. 

00:25:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, Dr. Albert Ellis, this has been an exciting half hour here. We've got just a couple of minutes left, and I wonder if there's any final thought you might like to leave our viewers with. 

00:25:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD The main thing is to accept responsibility for what you do, you do it, it doesn't do itself, but never to damn yourself or other human beings, no matter how abominable or stupid or incompetent your behavior. 

00:26:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD No matter how low you've gone, no matter what you've done in your life, you can respect and accept yourself as a human being. 

00:26:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and in a sense you can like yourself and dislike what you do, and acknowledge what you do, and again work to change it. But even if you never change, you are you. You are neither good nor bad. You are a person who does good and bad, self-helping and self-defeating things. Now, how do you stop it and change? 

00:26:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. In, in a sense, there, you know, there's a paradox in all of this. It's as if you're telling people they have to face the worst, and in facing the worst there's always a, a ray of hope, there's always a sense of optimism. 

00:26:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, because you face it, because you don't put yourself down for it, because you see that with hard work and practice thinking, emoting, and behaving you can change, because almost invariably you can. 

00:26:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, Dr. Albert Ellis, it's been a pleasure sharing this half hour with truly one of the giants in the field of psychology. Thank you very much for being with me. 

00:27:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD It's good to have been here, Jeff. 

00:27:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And thank you very much for being with us.

JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Hello, I'm Jeffrey Mishlove with Dr Albert Ellis. For the next hour we'll be exploring the techniques of rational-emotive therapy. Al, in your book A Guide to Rational Living, which has sold over a million copies, you suggest that, to some extent, the people can apply the techniques of rational-emotive therapy on themselves, in their own life, without using a therapist. And maybe we could being by discussing when you need to get help from a therapist, or coach, and when you can just do it to yourself. 

00:28:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PhD Psychotherapist 

00:28:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yeah. Many people can do it themselves, as even (inaudible ) Karen Horney once said many years ago, and a few others, that we think in RET, even though I devised it with clients, or what others call patients, we call them clients, that they could apply it themselves. That they could do it by reading, and by listening to cassettes, and only a year after I originated rational-emotive therapy in 1955, in 1956 I started to write, and wrote How to Live With a Neurotic, which is still in print, North Hollywood, Wilshire Books, and consequently, I decided that that helped people so much, the reading, that we give pamphlets and books to our clients, and many, many people, millions of people. A New Guide to Rational Living, the revised version, has sold over a million copies over the years. It still sells scores of thousands every year. 

00:29:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, and I'm sure the people who are viewing this tape will have a little pamphlet that comes with the tape giving them an address to send away for for additional materials, and, and books of this sort. But let, let's take a typical example. In fact, let me give you a real one, for me. 

00:29:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk)Right. (inaudible ) 

00:29:37
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD I have a little trouble taking weight off. 

00:29:37
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:29:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Now, if I want to apply RET on a problem like that, how might I, uh, do it? 

00:29:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, you'd start with assuming that you have some, one, or two, or three nutty musts. Cherche le should. Cherche le must. Look for the should, look for the must, and as you cram the extra food down your craw, not the regular food, what must are you telling yourself? (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 

00:30:04
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD I must enjoy it. I must have it. I must not deny myself this pleasure. (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:30:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. I must have immediate gratification right now, even thought it does me in later. Now, we would show you how to use the scientific method disputing that why must you, not why is better that you enjoy yourself right now. Why do you have to, and destroy yourself with the extra weight, the high blood pressure, etc later. Why must you? 

00:30:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, of course I'm sophisticated enough. I know that it's not true that I must. I -- 

00:30:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD But I should get what I want. You see, you lightly know, in quotation marks, that you don't have to, but you strongly believe that God dammit, I have to. I should. I must (crosstalk)in that case. 

00:30:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD It's as if there's this childish part inside of me that's not as sophisticated as I might think I am. 

00:30:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. Your strong, irrational beliefs, which you invented as a child, which you -- 

00:30:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:30:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Actually gone over thousands, if not millions, of times that you devoutly believe, are stronger than your rational belief; I don't need the damn food, I could live without it. 

00:31:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD I know. It's like there's no tomorrow. 

00:31:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right. Right. So, we get you to see the must, and then fight it in many cognitive thinking, and many emotive-dramatic-evocative forceful ways, 'cause you hold it very forcefully, vehemently, vigorously, and to fight it by acting against behaviorally. 

00:31:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD (crosstalk) Well. 

00:31:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD The three ways. 

00:31:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD I suppose though, and, eh, with me, and probably with many other sophisticated, intelligent people, the trick here is that we might be a little too compliant. We might say, "Yes, of course. I know that I mustn't do that." and at that point we stop working on ourselves. 

00:31:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right. We use it as a rationalization. Since I know it, in quotation marks, therefore I don't have to use my knowledge, apply my knowledge, and so I'll diet tomorrow. 

00:31:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:31:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Famous last words. 

00:31:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Uh-huh, but if I want to apply that knowledge what, what would be some appropriate steps? 

00:32:00
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, as I said, the first one is to acknowledge that if you have the must -- 

00:32:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD (crosstalk) Mm-hm 

00:32:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD You are making (ph)self. And incidentally, you might have two musts, because first, you might be making yourself anxious, depressed, I must do well, I must be loved, I must do well, I must be loved, then, because you're depressed and anxious, you need immediate -- 

00:32:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD (crosstalk) Oh, yeah. 

00:32:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Diversion, distraction, and the food is not only pleasant, good, but you can actually preoccupy yourself (crosstalk)with eating. 

00:32:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD It's a gratification. It takes one's mind away from that anxiety which I must not have. 

00:32:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right. 

00:32:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Uh-huh. 

00:32:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That right. You see low frustration (inaudible ), I must not be anxious, I must not be anxious. So, we would get you to first look at the low frustration (inaudible ). Why must you have the food? And, of course, the answer is that you don't have to, but also go back to your original anxiety, which very, very frequently you do have, and say, "Why must you do well? Why must you be loved? Why must you get rid of other kinds of discomfort and frustration?" And so you, there's never a reason for a must, because if you must do well, you would. The universe would be that way, and obviously it isn't, you see. So we get rid of need, necessity, must, dogma, and get you to say, "I like to do very well, but I don't have to. Too bad. Tough, if I don't." Then you lose the original anxiety. Then you still might eat for the immediate pleasure, the gratification. 

00:33:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. So let me, so let me just be very clear -- 

00:33:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:33:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD That any time that I hear myself in my mind, or in speaking, or hear anybody else use a should or a must, I can be certain that there's an irrational idea there. 

00:33:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, not certain. We don't believe in certainty, but almost certain -- 

00:33:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD (ph)Okay. 

00:33:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD A higher degree of probability, and, again, we distinguish between preferably should, and unconditionally, under all conditions at all times. We preferably should listen to ourselves right now, and speak very well, and try to make ourselves clear, but we don't have to under all conditions, and we're not worthless or no good if we don't. So, watch the should, and see whether it is an outstanding dogma, a real demand, command, Jehovian command as we call it in RET, or it's a strong preference, a very strong preference could be very legitimate. 

00:34:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. In other words, you're careful to distinguish between my thought that if I lose weight I'll be healthier, so I should do it for that reason. 

00:34:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Preferably. Right. (crosstalk) Put it in a preferable. 

00:34:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD As opposed to I have to lose weight or I'm going to be a terrible person. 

00:34:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and no matter what I have to lose weight. Even if I'm thin, I will, and I have to be perfectly thin, anorexia, incidentally, and I have to keep losing weight, and kill myself, literally. So, you look for the kinds of shoulds; the commands, the oughts, the absolutes, the dogmas, and you rip them up many, many times in different ways. And also, sometimes, distract yourself temporarily from the one cognitive method is relaxation, meditation, yoga, entertainment, all of which distracts you from the anxiety, and distracts you from the food. And they'll work temporarily, but we want you to make what we call a profound philosophic change, meaning that you see those musts, make them very conscious, 'cause they're slightly, or somewhat unconscious at times, Just below the surface consciousness, and then fight like hell to dispute them, to give them up. 

00:35:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Now, I think unlike the recommendations of Skinner, the famous behaviorist -- 

00:35:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:35:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD You work with negative reinforcement, or with punishment, as a technique for behavioral change. 

00:35:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Except we call it penalization, because punishment includes damnation, and we're against all damning of humans, including yourself, but you're right. I have this famous penalty that I was given by two, by a client many years ago, and that is, if you really don't want to overeat, let us say you want to force yourself, in a sense, you make it more penalizing, and one of the things you can do is every time you eat ten extra calories, burn a hundred dollar bill or give it to a cause that you hate, like the return of Richard Nixon to the White House, or something like that. Any cause that you hate, you give it them and say, "I love your cause. Here's this contribution." So, we have very many other penalties because, although children, as B.F. Skinner rightly showed, are reinforceable mainly by pleasures, by rewards because they'll do anything for M&Ms. They're crazy. Adult offenders, DC, difficult customers, in therapy won't do that, so we also, we use reinforcement very often, but we also, sometimes get them to give themselves, we don't give it to them, they give themselves penalties, and that will frequently work very well. 

00:36:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Eh, I recall a famous quote of yours, if a client tells you, "I just can't do this." You'd say, "Well, if I cut one of your toes off every time you did it, would you then be able to?" 

00:37:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yeah, and there was a famous, oh, not a famous, but I saw a movie on TV where this guy is working for the, uh, Union Army in the Civil War, and they want him to work for the Union, uh, for the, uh, other army, the Civil War, the Southern Army, when they capture him, and he won't do it. So, the Rebel chief shoots off one of his fingers and says, "Every day I come there'll be another finger shot off until you work." Well, how long does he think he changed his allegiance? Immediately. 

00:37:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PhD 

00:37:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD So, what you're saying is that any time we tell ourselves I can't do this, I can't change. I can't -- 

00:37:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Right. 

00:37:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Reach this or that goal, uh, eh, that again (crosstalk) that -- 

00:37:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD As I must. 

00:37:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD As I must. That there's something irrational there. 

00:37:55
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Usually, because you can't flap your hands and fly, but usually you can change your feelings, especially your disturbed feelings, because in RET we pretty much insist, not dogmatically insist, that you create your disturbances. Not your values and goals, you're given them by your culture, and even then you accept those values and goals, but you say, "I must achieve those values and goals, and therefore, since it's your must, you can give it up, undo it. So, when you say, "I can't." you mean difficult to -- 

00:38:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:38:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD But it's not impossible. 

00:38:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD But for example, controlling anger. 

00:38:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. Now even then, let's take controlling anger. We don't go for controlling anger, we got rid of, gi, giving it up. We getting rid of it, but you could even, if you wanted, if your boss, you have this beautiful job, and you really don't want to get fired, and your boss is highly obnoxious, eh, you could go home and beat your wife, tell your boss, or do some other things and control your anger, but we say give it up. Anger is the Jehovian command I am the Lord Thy God, and I know that you are doing the Wrong Thing, capital W capital T, and you should do the Right Thing, capital R capital T, and you are no damn good for doing the wrong thing because you must not do what I say you must not do. And if you give that up and say, "I know you're doing the wrong thing," 'cause maybe you're right about that, "yet you have the right to be wrong. You're a fallible human. You're allowed to be wrong. Too bad. Tough that you are." then you'll be sorry and displeased. We don't want you to be unemotional when people do the wrong thing, or treat you unjustly, but you can change your anger to displeasure, and sorrow, and regret. 

00:39:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And, and yet there are many very influential schools of psychotherapy that say you should get into your anger, express it, uh, have a catharsis. 

00:39:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:39:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD You -- 

00:39:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD And in, in my book How to, uh, Live With and Without Anger I show that there are 400 experiments, and that book was written several years ago, which shows that the more you express your anger in Reichian Therapy, or Primal Therapy, or any of those other nutty therapies, that the more you do so the angrier and the more punitive you usually become. The experiments, and these are not clinical cases, experiments tend to show this. 

00:40:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:40:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD So, we say acknowledge your anger, don't deny it. Don't put yourself down for feeling enraged, even if it's against your sacred mother. If you don't like her, you don't like her. If you hate her, you hate her. And then say, "I created the anger. She did me in, maybe, but I created the anger. What do I do to give up my demand, my command that she not be the way she indubitably is." Which is very funny, because how could she not be the way she indubitably is? And then you actually get rid of it, but you have to do it 1,000 times before it stays away. 

00:40:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And so this does require a lot of real work? 

00:40:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD A lot of reinforcement in the sense of repetition and going over and over, and acting. We get you to act unangrily, or to face you mother. Suppose you're enraged every time you see her or talk to her on the phone, we get you to in-vivo do what you're afraid to face, and train yourself, condition yourself to become much less, or non-angry as you originally, even as a child, conditioned yourself to make yourself angry. 

00:41:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD So, it sounds to me as if you're distinguishing between acknowledging my anger, saying, "I am angry. I feel angry."-- 

00:41:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:41:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And acting it out, and sort of beating up on somebody. 

00:41:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, expressing it. 

00:41:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Uh-huh. 

00:41:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Now, sometimes it's better to assert yourself. We're, I'm a pioneer in the assertion training things. The famous book called Your Perfect Right which shows you how to be assertive, but not aggressive, but that was written in 1971. In 1963 in The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Dating and Mating, in the first edition, I have a famous chapter called How to Be Assertive Without Being Aggressive. 

00:41:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:41:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD So we teach how to be assertive. To say, "I want x." or "I don't want y." but not to be combative, violent, aggressive against other humans. 

00:42:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD But what do you do when you're in the throws of some kind of aggressive impulse? 

00:42:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, you tell yourself immediately, "I'm creating this." and you try, and you have to train yourself as I've trained myself, to say, "What am I telling myself?" They shouldn't be this way. Well hell, they should be the way they indubitably are, and get rid of it, or you could use other intermittent eh, relaxation techniques, or other techniques to interrupt, you could take a walk, the famous one of taking a walk, count to 30. 

00:42:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:42:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD You see, there are many things to interrupt it, but the main thing is to interrupt it cognitively, philosophically so that it really comes back. That's the elegant solution in RET. 

00:42:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD I love, uh, one of your phrases in which, when you say, "How could they do this to me?" you say, "Of course. They're talented at it." 

00:42:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right, or how could they be the way they are? Easily. They have no trouble being the abominable way they are. 

00:43:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Uh-huh. Well, you know must mention that you're really quite, uh, renowned in some way for your use of salty language as a way of affecting change, and -- 

00:43:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, because people, uh, get used to the conventional thing, and when I get after them, for example I'll just give you, uh, a usual example, a little old lady comes in, and says, "I feel worthless." and I say, "Oh, you feel like a shit, don't you?" and she says, "How did you know?" because that's the language she talks to herself. You see, she'll never tell her friends, or use the word in public, but she talks to herself that way. And then, as soon as I say that she's free to say all kinds of things, so it loosens people up, sexually and non-sexually when you use good English, Anglo-Saxon four letter words. Now, it doesn't always do that, 'cause some people object strenuously, but if young males, adolescent males, object to my use of language, then it's a good diagnostic sign that they're psychotic. 

00:44:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD (laughter) Are there limits to our ability to, to analyze ourself, logically, to uncover all of our rational thoughts? 

00:44:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yes, and we are limited, and I have a whole famous chapter in 1962 in Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy showing the limits of all psychotherapy including RET, because we naturally, easily think straight, and we train ourselves to do it, and we're not geniuses, and even genius would have trouble always thinking straight. Now, let me give you an example, there are very blatant irrational beliefs which anybody could see. and say, "Well, yes, that's irrational." Under all conditions, at all times I absolutely must be the best tennis player in the world. Even McEnroe, nobody could so that, so that's crazy. But because I work so hard at tennis, and I'm a nice guy and a scholar, therefore I must succeed at tennis is just as crazy. It's a complete non sequitur, and people subtly think that way, and I think it's the human condition -- 

00:45:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD (crosstalk) Mm-hm. 

00:45:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD To think that way. So you'll never be an I am not completely rational. That's Utopian. That's nutty. 

00:45:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:45:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD And I must be rational, I must be rational is also nutty, because that upsets you. So, then there's no way you're going to be completely so unless the human race finally changes genetically. 

00:45:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD So, in effect, what you're saying is, eh, part of the method of rational-emotive therapy is to apply rationality whenever you can, and it's very rational to accept that you can't do it all the time. 

00:45:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right. You can't, and you won't, and you're lucky to do it much of the time, or a good deal of the time, or most of the time, but you're never going to do it all of the time. No human is superhuman, and you really have to be superhuman to do it all of the time. 

00:45:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, if I may, let me throw this back at you a little bit, because as I look at your life, as a person who is in my field of psychology, I almost think my God, this man is superhuman. He's published 600 articles. He's written 50 books. He's seen 20,000 clients. He's trained 1,000 therapists. He's, he's almost perfect. He's been given every honor. He's regarded as, perhaps one of the two or three most influential psychotherapists in the field of psychology, and I'm honestly very honored to be with you, and, and yet I'm sure, or I suspect that you yourself come up against your own fallibility, your own weaknesses, and I wonder if we could talk a little bit about how you deal with it. 

00:46:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, what I do is especially, again at my famous Friday night workshops in New York, where I interview people in public, and you know how crazy the public is in New York City. They come right off the street, and volunteer, and I've never seen them before, and I give them eh, sessions of rational-emotive therapy right in public, and then throw it open to the audience to discuss. I tell the audience not to speak up right now because the walls are, reverberate, and their neighbor will hear them more than us. And then they start speaking up, and I look at them and say, "Now, that means you." and they shut up, but some of don't. Some of them keep talking, or whisper. I'm not talking, my neighbor is talking. I say, "You're talking right now. Shut up. We want to get on with the workshop." I'm displeased, but then they keep on, and I say, "Now look, if you keep talking like that, get back in the john and talk to yourself in the God damn john!" Now I'm angry. I'm not just displeased. I'm damning them, really, and the audience can see it, and I say to myself, "Oh hell. I made myself angry. I demanded, commanded they shouldn't do what they're indubitably doing, but they should!" I say to myself very quickly, and then I, while I'm still doing the workshop, get over it. But I'm irrational -- 

00:47:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:47:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD At that point. And incidentally, I think I inherited that tendency from my father who was brilliant but irascible, and quite angry much of time, while my mother was around all the time, it was a very nice person, very rarely angry. So I have my own fallibility. My own limitations. I'm very rarely, very rarely make myself anxious or depressed, practically never, but I'm still prone to the anger. 

00:48:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD I would, I would that in your position you must demand an awful lot of yourself to keep performing, and to keep experiencing the same kind of results with clients. 

00:48:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right. I, but I don't like the word demand. I ask a lot of myself, and I watch myself, and I see people from 9:30 in the morning till 11 at night very frequently in the Institute for Rational Emotive Therapy in New York. And then I write in addition, and do supervision, and go around the world giving talks and workshops, and do many things, but I do it because I want to do it, but don't have to. And when recently I had a hiatal hernia operation that kept me out of action for a few weeks, too bad, tough, it's not the end of the world. So, I want, I prefer, I like in the one life. I think I'm gonna live to get much in, to do all kinds of things, and varied things, but I don't think it's a command, or a demand. I think it's a wish, and because I wish rather than command, I don't get anxious, I don't get upset, so therefore, I'm more efficient than I would otherwise be. 

00:49:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. We, you know, I'm getting to the point, after having listened to a number of your tapes that when I hear that phrase too bad, tough shit I, I think of you right away. 

00:49:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. That's, I'm famous for that. 

00:49:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD For saying tough shit. Eh, let's talk a little more about that state of mind. It's like gritting your teeth and bearing it, but you know that life's gonna go on, things'll get better, things'll get worse. 

00:49:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Or you'll make them better by saying, "Tough shit." while you say, "Oh, how awful. I can't bear it. The world is going to come to an end." Then you make things worse, and it's tougher shit that way. So, I show people it's hard to change because you biologically, and sociologically, and by your own conditioning and training are the way you are, but it's harder if you don't change, therefore you better. You don't have to change. 

00:50:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. You use the word sometimes, DC, for uh, -- 

00:50:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Difficult customer. 

00:50:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Difficult customer. 

00:50:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:50:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD These, these are people who are really stuck in their behavior patterns -- 

00:50:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Right. 

00:50:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD They're very resistant to therapy -- 

00:50:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Right. 

00:50:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And uh, I should say starting out, I, I had a chance to read your book exploring resistance and -- 

00:50:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Right. 

00:50:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Therapy. It's one of your newer books, and you point out that many times that this is healthy. 

00:50:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. That lots of time when you're difficult, you resist, you rebel against your culture, or your family, or sometimes even your work - you may do it differently than other people, that's okay. But if you're over-rebellious then you cut off your nose to spite your face. You don't wear your rubbers because your nutty mother insisted you must wear your rubbers, now you'll never wear your rubbers. So, rebellion can be sane, rational, efficient, good, goading you to do things differently, but over-rebelliousness is childish rebelliousness is likely to do you in. 

00:51:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And what are some of the special techniques that you've cultivated for dealing with DCs, (crosstalk) difficult customers 

00:51:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, one is what a lot of other psychotherapists don't like, and I'm afraid that they have problems with it, I can be more direct, and more active. Now, with lots of people I'm just calm and serene. Just show them the ABCs that at A, they get something bad that they don't like, and at B the tell themselves, "I can't it. I must, it must not be this way." and C, they get upset, and at D they dispute. I can do that. But, with others, they don't do it, or they do it badly, or they say, "I can't do it." when they can, so then I say, "Okay, if you say you can't change your thinking, go be sick! I can show you how to be sicker than you are, 'cause I'm an expert in how people make themselves disturbed, emotionally disturbed. If you want to do that, I'll do that." So, I get after them quite strongly, but that doesn't mean everybody. This is just some of the difficult customers who I get after that way. 

00:52:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, well let's highlight this notion -- 

00:52:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yeah. 

00:52:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD That you mentioned a moment ago about being directive, because -- 

00:52:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Right. 

00:52:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Clearly there are schools of psychotherapy; the Rogerians, and the Humanists, and the Existentialists, and the Jungians who, who suggest that, that any time a therapist is directive -- 

00:52:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:52:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD It's counter-therapeutic, and, and you're saying just the -- 

00:52:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Right. 

00:52:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Opposite. 

00:52:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD And even some of the cognitive behavior therapies, such as the school of Aaron Beck, imply that you have to go slowly and easily, and gain enormous rapport, and you can't be direct 'cause people will resist and then come back. Now, in to some degree that is correct, so it's not completely incorrect. But I say that there are at least 30% of clients, and often the members of the public, who, the more direct you are, the more they respect you 'cause they know no nonsense about it. No shit, you're gonna do what you do, and you're not afraid that they won't love you. And they get it quickly, and why let them suffer, and be indirect. 

00:53:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:53:00
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD So, directness isn't necessary. You can do RET in a boyscout/ girl-scout manor, which some of the other cognitive behavioral therapists really do it, but I prefer much of the time, and not all of the time, to be quite open, honest, direct, be myself, 'cause that's the way I think I naturally am, and consequently I think my hypothesis is that that's more effective in a shorter length of time for most people than the indirect, namby pamby, boyscout/ girl-scout kind of therapy. 

00:53:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And I think, in daily life, we come across this all the time, and you've written about it in your book How to Deal With a Neurotic, I mean -- 

00:53:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:53:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD if, if a person is very defensive in the classical Freudian sense, the, the advice I remember I received as an undergraduate is never tell them they're defensive, they'll just get more defensive 

00:53:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, but I show them that they're defensive, but then I show them what they're telling themselves, what they're philosophy to make them defensive, and we have another technique which works beautifully, and that is we unconditionally accept all humans, no matter how obnoxious they are, and if they don't pay their therapy bills to our institute we still accept them, and show them how to accept themselves, and once they see that they are acceptable, not good people, but that they always can accept themselves with their crummy behavior, they are not crumbs, they just do crummy behavior - then they realize that their defenses are to protect themselves from damning, blaming themselves, We're getting rid of the damning and blaming, then they very frequently, spontaneously, easily become undefensive. So, the Freudian show them finally that they're defensive, but they don't know how to get rid of it. 

00:54:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD So, if I can summarize what you've just said, it seems that in order to be direct with another person, and to do it successfully, there, there are really two requirements. One is that you really accept them unconditionally. 

00:54:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Right. 

00:54:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD And the other is that you kind of get underneath to, to the belief systems, to, to aspects of their behavior that they can change, and show them constructively what they can do about their defensiveness. 

00:55:00
ALBERT ELLIS, PhD Psychotherapist 

00:55:00
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and the third thing that you don't need their love and approval, as unfortunately most therapists do need the love and approval of their clients, and they fart around and do very little because that supposed they did the wrong thing, and their clients quit them, or didn't love them, didn't pay them, and that would be awful. So you better add that third thing to the two you rightly said. 

00:55:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. Well, I, I should imagine that, you know, having seen some 20,000 clients and trained as many therapists as you have that, that it would only be fair to, to point out that you must have seen some, some things that were terribly disappointing for you. 

00:55:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Very disappointing. Some of the people I've worked hardest with get least better, and some of the people on the other hand, that I hardly do anything with and read our literature, they hated their mother for 30 years, and I showed them briefly, now look, she should be the way she is because, alas, she is, too bad that she has serious problems, and they read my book on Anger: How to Live With It and Without It, and they get over it in three sessions or two sessions, their hatred. So, some things are very good, and some things are very disappointing. You never can predict in advance. You can guess, but you can't predict how effective you will be, even though you may be acting that you think, or I think, is effective. 

00:56:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, (sound of watch alarm ) you developed rational-emotive therapy some time ago, back in 1956. 

00:56:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD '55 

00:56:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And is your alarm going off there, or is that mine? 

00:56:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Oh, it goes off once in a while, and I can't even hear it. 

00:56:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Okay, well I... 

00:56:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Great alarm, but I don't hear it, and the high notes these days I don't hear that much. 

00:56:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Alright, I'm not going to bother with it -- 

00:56:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) No. No. 

00:56:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Any further then, but let, let me go back to, to this issue, because you develop this therapy -- 

00:56:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Yeah. Right. 

00:56:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Movement back in 1955, how has it evolved in your mind? Has, has it lived up to the hopes that you've had for it? uh, Do you see this as, as a movement which can ultimately, really make an impact on society? uh, Has it changed since the early days? 

00:57:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, first of all it has changed, because it was always cognitive-emotional-behavioral, now it's added many other techniques, some of which I took from the encounter movement and other movements which are okay and from people whose form of therapy I really don't agree with, but some of the things they did are okay. So, it has changed and it's grown theoretically. It is a much more profound and comprehensive theory than it originally was. It was relatively simple, and now it's more complex and comprehensive. But then, the thing that really changed is from 1955 to about 1970 I was persona non grata to the whole psychotherapy movement except Rudolph Dreikurs, the Adlerian. I got along with him, and almost nobody else in the movement. And Carl Rogers hated my guts, though he would never say so, and, uh, Fritz Perls was screamed and yelled at the panels I was on with him that I was boring and too rational, and all kinds of other people screamed against me, and we didn't get very far. The minority were solidly with me. Some of the people still with me from that time. And in 1968, for example, Edmund Felton, that I mentioned before, did a very profound study showing that some of the principles of RET are in all probability true. But then, in around 1970-71, '69, Donald Meichenbaum and several other good researchers at universities started showing by experiments, not by clinical studies, there had been a few before that, but they really started showing in droves in the 70s that cognitive, and cognitive behavioral therapy, and especially RET, really was on the ball, and produced effective results quite quickly, and results that lasted longer. And we've had now over 200 experiments which show that, experiments, not case histories. 1000s of case histories are pure fiction. Freud almost got the, the Nobel Prize for Literature, and he deserved, because of the fiction he wrote about his case histories. And then, another 250 studies showed that my original irrational ideas put in test form really did discriminate between disturbed -- 

00:59:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

00:59:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD And less disturbed individuals. So, then it became very popular. Now it's really probably the most popular form of therapy used by almost clinicians, psychotherapists including psychoanalysts and the Gestalt therapists who throw it in without acknowledging it, but they throw it in. So, cognitive behavioral therapy and RET has been a revolution, a cognitive revolution, since 1970, and is now exceptionally popular. 

00:59:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, you know, as I look at your career I get the sense this man is something of a rebel, of a revolutionary yourself, by -- 

00:59:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

00:59:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Instinct. I mean, here you are in the early 50s telling people to approach sex without guilt. Telling people that, you know, in, in radical ways to think of their lives in rational terms when, and, and fighting against an enormous body of tradition in psychotherapeutic authority, uh, and on top of that using, uh, four letter words, and, and so-called vulgar language in, in scientific, uh, (crosstalk) meetings. 

01:00:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD And using them at professional meetings where they're absolutely verboten! 

01:00:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Yeah. So, eh, you know I, I can feel that because of my own field, which I know you're not too fold of, parapsychology, there's that same sense of you're up against the establishment and, -- 

01:00:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Right. 

01:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And that's very hard to deal with. You must've had to practice your own principles in order to fight that battle. 

01:00:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Oh, yes. Without RET used on myself I might never have originated it, but I certainly wouldn't have kept it up because there was so much vituperation against me, and so many things, because of my sex views and my other views, that people made up against me, such as I've had eight wives. I've had a lousy two wives, far from eight, and all kinds of other things: that I'm gay and straight, I sleep with all my female clients and all my male clients, which would be pretty good if I was able to manage it, and all kinds of lies about me, but especially against RET, that it's too simplistic, it really doesn't work, people will always fall back. And I said to myself that, "Too bad that these people believe that way, they obviously do, but it's not horrible, it's not awful, it's not terrible. I can take it, and I don't need their approval." So, I went on, and on, and on and I think only because I went on did it finally start catching, because the whole thing could've, presumably, been abandoned. 

01:01:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD So, you had to deal with then, on the one hand, the, the disapproval of your colleagues and your peers, and on the other hand, uh, occasional, and maybe even frequent, dramatic therapeutic failures. 

01:01:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right. Right. There are many failures because even RET doesn't have all successes. I think it has more proportional and percentage successes than any of the other therapies, but lots of times people either won't use it, or I'm incapable of getting them to use it because it's a persuasive therapy, or something else occurs. Tough. Too bad. That's the way it is. I can plow on and still enjoy what I do, even though I don't enjoy some of the results. 

01:02:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm, but there's something else as I look at your life, not only did you say, "Tough shit," and plow on, but something kept you from changing your direction. I mean, you could've very rationally said to myself, "This is, uh, more than I want to deal with." 

01:02:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

01:02:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD You could've become a conventional sex therapist, for all I know, or something a little less pioneering, and, and I wonder if you could kind of get into that. What kept you focused? 

01:02:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, I think that one, I am a naturally born rebel because I started rebelling against religion and other things at the age of 12. I was skeptical of much of what I read. I read some of the good rebels, like H. G. Wells and Bertrand Russell, but I also had it on my own, and two, I'm involved. I'm passionate. To be a rebel, one had better really follow, and I hope not devoutly or fanatically, but really involvedly follow what you want, and not get upset by the failures. The great inventors, and the great Nobel Prize winners the thing that differentiates them from other is when they fail, which they often do - gen, as Edison said, "Genius is nine tenths inp, perspiration, and one tenth inspiration." So, you often fail, and Edison failed, the film and several other things that people have forgotten about, then we don't view it, we view it as a failing, but not us as a failure, and we plow ahead, we're still involved, we still are determined to do better, to do better, to change, change, change. So, I think I have that nature biologically, and then I use RET on myself to help me have it sociologically and conditionally. 

01:04:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, you use the term passion, and passionate, and I think, uh, this is a crucial term, uh, and I know you apply it in your therapy as well. I mean, you're a man who was born in 1913, if I'm correct. 

01:04:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

01:04:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And you are working a very active and full life right now, as you have for many, many years. There's a passion -- 

01:04:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

01:04:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD For your work that keeps you going, and many times when you see a client, if I'm correct, that's what lacking in their life is that passionate sense of enjoying life even when it's lousy. 

01:04:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD They're non-involved. 

01:04:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

01:04:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Or they're involved with horseshit, and they really devoutly believe in that horseshit, but they're non-involved in constructive, self-fulfilling, self-actualizing behaviors, and thoughts, and feelings and I think I am, so that modeling, incidentally, is good for them. 

01:04:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

01:04:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD It's not the only thing, but it's one of the cognitive things, modeling, as Albert Bandura has shown, which helps them, that I am passionate and involved. (laughter) It's very funny that I once debated with Daniel Casriel, A Scream Away From Happiness. I knew Danny, and he was a, when he was psychoanalyst, and very prim and proper, and without giving any credit to Wilhelm Reich or anything like that, he started having these people scream and hug each other, but he was good on, he was a good advocate of anger. So, I debated on him with the institute many years ago on anger, and I passionately was against anger, and Danny was namby pambily, and boyscout-ishly for anger, and it was very amusing. The people in the audience noted it. 

01:05:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Uh-huh. Well, you often, when clients experience what is clinically called anhedonia, the lack of the ability to find pleasure in life, you work with them to do anything that would be pleasurable (crosstalk) for themselves. 

01:05:50
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, to A, get rid of their nonsense, which interferes, which it often does, but two, to experiment, to try. And in the back of my book, the appendix of my book A Guide to Personal Happiness I have a list of about 200 pleasures which people can experiment with, and try and see which ones fit them. So, I urge, I don't compel, but I encourage people to enjoy, to have a great fucking ball in life, that's one of the main things that they can do. 

01:06:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And this notion of experimenting seems to me to be kind of an important thrust of your work. I mean, you in fact say that man is a natural scientist. 

01:06:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

01:06:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD That we're always kind of testing, and experimenting, and it's this sense of, of experimentation in a playful way, I think that. that colors much of your work. 

01:06:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Yeah, well I call it a brilliant cognitivist, cognitive therapist George Kelly, that we naturally are scientists because we predict things in advance, and then check on our predictions, but he forgot to say we're poor scientists. So, I try to get people to be less dogmatic, and more experimental, and better scientists than they naturally are. 

01:07:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. I mean, I get a sense, talking to you now that if any of your rational-emotive, uh, therapists were to attempt to work with a client in any kind of experimental way whatsoever, and monitor the feedback, and then report honestly to themselves and their client about the results of that process, you wouldn't object. 

01:07:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD No, no, no. And we do have some people who have done that kind of thing. Right. 

01:07:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And, in fact, there's a lot of creativity in the rational-emotive therapy movement I think as a result of that freedom to explore that you, you -- 

01:07:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yes. 

01:07:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Inculcate by your very example. 

01:07:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD You just reminded me, one of the things we try to get people to do, which they don't do when they're disturbed, is be more creative. We creatively go after their un, or anti-creativity, and try to get them to be more challenging, more risk-taking, more creative, and not always, but we often succeed. 

01:08:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm, but I suppose, the nuts and bolts or your work is, comes right down to the concept of disputing. 

01:08:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and we take each of the major ideas: first, the must, why must I do well, there's no reason, it would be nice, but not necessary; two, why is it awful when I don't do as well as I must, it's not awful, it's a pain in the ass, it's inconvenient, and I can still live and enjoy it; why can't I bear failing, I can, I won't die of it, and I can still go on and lead a happy, though not as happy, a life; why am I no good for failing, I am a person who acted badly, failed, but I am an individual who does thousands, millions of other things, and therefore I am not rate-able, only my behavior; and why will I always fail, I won't always fail, I can't prove an always or never. So, we rip up all these derivatives of the musts as well as the basic musts themselves, and any other irrationalities, which they bring up. 

01:09:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD You use the term LFT, low-frustration tolerance -- 

01:09:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD (crosstalk) Right. 

01:09:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD For, uh, the kind of a person who, even if you tell them, "Tough shit, That's too bad." they say, "Well, that's awful that it's too bad. It's awful that it's tough shit." They don't want anything negative at all. They can't tolerate that. They're, they're your DCs, your difficult customers I (crosstalk) suppose. 

01:09:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, they're, I've done several studies of my own clients and families, and found out that the main reason why they resist, not the only reason, is low-frustration tolerance. Now, we're not against giving, uh, taking frustrating things, and working against them, saying, "They're no good. I'm gonna determine to work against them." having some degree of frustration intolerance. But low-frustration tolerance means, again, that this frustration must not exist, and I can't tolerate it at all, and the world's a horrible, rotten place for having it. Screw it, I'm not going to do what I could do to get over it. Now, we get people to give up that LFT, low-frustration tolerance, and then have higher frustration tolerance, and then work, work, work, work, work to get what they want, to stop their procrastinating, and to do other things that they could do, perform, achieve, and enjoy doing. 

01:10:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And the basic method of disputing that is, is successful. It just maybe takes longer with these people. 

01:10:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yes. With these people they have such abysmal low-frustration tolerance that they use it at the therapy, and say, "You, the therapist, are making me do hard things as you should not, must not. It's too hard. It must not be that hard. How awful that it's that hard." so they won't work at the therapy. But we show them, and I don't know whether I originated it or AA originated it is no gain without pain, tough, it's much harder if you don't, now you'd better PYA, push your ass, to change. You don't have to, but you'd better because otherwise I can't change you. I can show you how to do it, but I never can do it for you. 

01:11:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And you advocate a lot of homework. 

01:11:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yes -- 

01:11:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD (crosstalk) Unlike some therapies. 

01:11:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD We're always behavioral. 

01:11:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Uh-huh. 

01:11:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Because the behavioral assignment I gave myself, years ago when I was 19, was to force myself, uncomfortably to speak, speak in public until I got over my fear of it, and to force myself to pick up women, pick up woman, pick up woman until I got over my fear of doing so. So, we always have activity, homework assignments, in-vivo, alive, as John B Watson did years ago with little children. He put a rabbit that they feared at one end of the table, a real live rabbit, not a picture of a rabbit, and a child at the other, and gradually got them closer while distracting and, the child, feeding the child, and they gave up their fears. These little kids at 5 and 6, and I said if, "Hell, if John B Watson can do it with little kiddies, I can do it with myself." So, I did it, did it, did it, and I always include, just about always, activity, in-vivo, alive homework assignments to do what you're afraid of, and stay in uncomfortable conditions until you make yourself comfortable, and then enjoying. 

01:12:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. So, you 're not at all alarmed when, uh, maybe a client comes to see you give them this homework, and things seem to get worse for them because they're confronting their fear? 

01:12:35
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD No. No, no, I, I want them to acknowledge their fears, to confront them, to feel it, and then to work against it. So, we're not alarmed. Now, of course, we may lose a few that way, 'cause they don't want to do it, and they may go to other therapists who keep them for nine or ten years, and pat 'em on the head, and I think they feel better, but I wrote a famous essay in 1972 saying To Feel Better is not to Get Better. RET tries to help you get better, not merely feel better. 

01:13:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD So, the client comes to you and says, "This is my problem. X behavior is just awful. I can't bear it. It is horrible." 

01:13:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

01:13:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And you say, "Okay, go out and do exactly that." They go out and do it, and then they come back and say that, "It was just as awful as I thought." 

01:13:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well, you forgot that first of all you're giving the second thing I get 'em to do, but while they're doing it we're always cognitive and behavioral, not just behavioral. We would get 'em to say, "If I do this, and it is very unpleasant, what makes it awful? What do I tell myself, think, cognize, philosophize to make it awful?" We get 'em to see it is not awful, just a pain in the ass. Then they very likely, not by any means completely, will not find it awful, and they may even find it pleasant to do. 

01:13:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Because basically what you're saying is that nothing is really awful. That's, that's the point of dispute that you take. 

01:14:00
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yes, because we prove that awful, there are catastrophes in the world. If 100 people get killed in a plane accident, or on a bridge or something that's a catastrophe. I mean, many bad things, or much bad things, very much happen. But awful means: one, very very bad, which lots of things are, a good many things, the Holocaust is as bad as can be; two, totally bad; three, more than bad, 110% bad; and four, badder than it must be. Now it can't even be totally bad because years ago I used to think that one thing was totally bad, and I said so: being tortured to death slowly. But then a psychologist in my audience said, "No, that's not totally bad. You could always be tortured to death slower." So, even that isn't 100%. You can't get up to 100%, but you can't get 110, and you can't get something that's 90% bad, and should only be 89. It should be 90 if it's 90. So, nothing is awful, horrible, or terrible, though many things are very, very bad, and you better accept that badness, and then do you best to change that (crosstalk) badness. 

01:15:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. Wha, uh, what about when a person comes to you, and they may say, "Well, this may ultimately not be very bad, but in my value system it's would be unbearable. Other people may be able to bear it, but because of my station in life, or the way I was raised, this, this would be just awful." 

01:15:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Well -- 

01:15:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Particularly upper class people, I should think. 

01:15:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD They are what we call tautologically, or definitionally, disturbed. That means that they're defining badness as awful. And I say, "You're entitled to do that. You can have any value system you want, but do you want to suffer? Would your value system take you something which is highly obnoxious, inconvenient, unpleasant, frustrating, and calling it awful you will really be off the wall. While if you call it what it, other people call it, or what it seems to be, very, very bad, against your interests, that's what bad really means, then you'll be displeased, and sorry, and determined to change it, or accept it if you cannot. Now, which do you want? Do you want the value system of awfulness, which you're entitled to, and I'll tell you several other nutty value systems that you could have? Do you want to believe in demons, which is really what awful is, it's a demon that you invent, or do you want to believe in badness, uncomfortableness that you can do something about, or accept?" And then, most of the time the one's that are not too difficult accept that it's not awful, but it is very, very bad. Okay, how do I change it or accept it? 

01:16:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Now, I would imagine that you've come up against, from time to time, clients who have fundamentalist religious views who believe that things can sometimes be damnably awful. 

01:16:55
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, or damnable. 

01:16:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Yeah. 

01:16:55
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD And I tell them that, look you're entitled to your view, but let's take a typical case. This boy masturbates, and he's guilty, and he comes to me, and he, I say, "What's wrong with masturbation?" and he says, "Well, it's against the Bible. In the Bible they say you roast in Hell, or something like that, in the Quran, or the Torah, or the Bible, but then I say, "Well, you're entitled to believe that. If you want to believe that, stop masturbating." Well, he dodn't want that solution to his problem. He wants to be able to masturbate and not be guilty, and the only way he can be is by taking his devout belief in whatever Bible he believes in, and making it, ameliorate it to a lesser devout beliefs, and one that masturbation is bad, he could still believe that, but it's badder not to masturbate, or God will accept me as a sinner. And I quote the Bible to him to accept the sinner, but not the sin. And in the Christian Bible you always get grace, no matter what you do, if you believe in Jesus, Jesus is the son of God and gives you grace. Now, go masturbate, and finally get grace, or something like that, or pick a, uh, a less fundamentalist part, religion. well, usually they're Protestant. Pick another Protestant sect, or a less fundamentalist Catholic sect, if you're a Catholic or an Orthodox Jew, and that's what they usually do. They pick a less fundamentalist view, and give up damnation, but they still are entitled to believe masturbation is wrong, and they'd better try to avoid it. that's okay. 

01:18:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD I like the term that you use, to give yourself grace. 

01:18:40
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and that's what we really do. Well, many people tell me, "You know, you say you're an atheist, but you're really a good Christian because you give yourself, or everybody, and we give everybody in RET, grace. And I say, "Yes, that's what we believe in." Again, you accept the sinner, and but, and even condemn the sin, and put people away, you don't let 'em run around, or let Hitler run around when he's sinning. So, you condemn the sin, but not the individual. You always give the individual grace, which we call full, complete, unconditional acceptance, whether or not he or she does well, whether or not he or she is loved. We always give grace, and we teach people to give themselves grace, with the Christian religion if they want to use that, or if they don't need the Christian religion. 

01:19:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Well, I think that puts you in a very enviable position, in a way, because you're able to come to a person, and very forthrightly tell them that their behavior is asinine, insane in some ways, and yet you accept them. 

01:19:45
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD That's right. They're not asses. They're behavior is asinine, but there is no such thing as a fool or an ass. That's back to Alfred Korzybski, and not over generalize, and we accept them, not their behavior, and we confront more than others. People say to me, "Well, do you like me?" and I said, "Well, frankly, if I met you socially I would boycott you." to my clients, many of them, but not all of them. They say, "Why?" and I say, "Because you're behavior is so crummy. Your behavior stinks, but you're not a stinker. Now, what are you going to do to change that behavior?" So, I can confront them. I don't need their love again, and I can show them that they act badly, but they aren't bad people. 

01:20:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And I guess it's, it's, you're ability to accept people so totally that allows you to be so direct. 

01:20:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. You see, if I were a condemner then I couldn't be, go in directly. I could, but it would probably wouldn't work. But because I'm a non-condemner they get the impression that Ellis really knows what he's talking about. He's authoritative, not authoritarian, which we're quite opposed to than authoritative, you know, maybe I better listen to him, and try some of the things he says. 

01:20:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD We've got about five minutes left, and I'd like to, to comment as we wrap up, uh, this hour I noticed, in several of your newer books you've used what's called E-prime -- 

01:21:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

01:21:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD As, as a way to write these books. A stylistic way of writing in which you totally eliminate the use of the verb to be -- 

01:21:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right. 

01:21:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Is, are, was, were. 

01:21:15
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Which I get from general semantics, again. 

01:21:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. 

01:21:20
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD It was recommended by Korzybski, but not used by him, but used by a few of his followers, who I followed. So, we try to teach people to use E-prime. Not to say, "I am a psychologist, because besides doing psychology, I do many other things. I eat, and go to the john, and do lots of things besides psychologize, and therefore no label." and Alfred Korzybski and general semantics are particularly against labeling. We teach people not to label themselves, nor to label other humans, and therefore E-prime helps them. We can still do it with E-prime -- 

01:21:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Yeah. 

01:21:55
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD But it helps you not do it. 

01:22:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD 'Cause when you say, "He is this. I am that." we're getting away from, I suppose, the process ra, eh, rather we make ourselves into things. 

01:22:05
ALBERT ELLIS, PhD Psychotherapist 

01:22:10
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and we imply, and we'll always be. You see, if I am a bad person, the implication is that I'll always be. Well, if I do bad things the implication is I don't have to. So that is, is a verity is of identity. Uh, I am what I do is very bad, as Korzybski and other general semanticists show. So, we're opposed to that. Teaching people not to over-generalize, which is one of the main essences, again, of human disturbance. To abstract the generalized is good, to over-generalize disturbs you, and that's why Korzybski's book was called Science and Sanity, and he was not a therapist. 

01:22:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. Well, Dr. Albert Ellis, it's been a real pleasure sharing this hour with you. We have a minute left -- 

01:23:00
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Yes. 

01:23:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And I wonder in closing if you have a final thought for our viewers. 

01:23:00
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD The main one, again, is cherche le should, cherche le must. It upsets you, not they upset you, and realize that you create it, and that you can always un-think what you think, and refuse to believe what you devoutly believe in a musterbatory fashion. 

01:23:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Look for the shoulds, and look for the musts. 

01:23:25
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD Right, and give 'em up. 

01:23:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD Mm-hm. Dr. Albert Ellis, thank you very much for being with me. 

01:23:30
ALBERT ELLIS, PHD It was great being here, Jeff. 

01:23:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PHD And thank you for being with us.
