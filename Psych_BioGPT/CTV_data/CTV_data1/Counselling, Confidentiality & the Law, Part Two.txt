MIKE SIMMONS So, Peter, I'm conscious that we've been talking about a number of scenarios when issues around confidentiality were what we were looking at. We're now gonna look at some other things. 

00:00:10
PETER JENKINS Yes, so, what we've been considering, so far, in the scenarios is a situation where a client has disclosed information to the counsellor. I guess that's integral to therapy, in a sense. I mean, therapy has de-, been described as, uh, a process of asymmetric disclosure. That is, the client discloses very sensitive, very personal information to the therapist, the therapist tends not to disclose, uh, equally, and, as a result, the therapist has this information. Now, the, kind of, scenarios that we've looked at raised issues of where that information points towards risk. So, it could be a risk of suicide, a risk of harm to others, a risk of harm to children; so, the therapist has a dilemma of what to do with that information. So, in what situations must they pass the information on, in what situations do they have a choice, and in what situations can they continue to protect confidentiality? Not that, by any means, these are easy choices or, or decisions to make and, and I guess, as we've tried to stress all along, that there is the aspect of the therapeutic alliance, which must, there has to be one consideration for the therapist, in addition to, what does the law formally require. The scenarios that we're about to look at, the situation is slightly different where, again, the client has disclosed very sensitive, very personal information to the therapist and people who may be outside the therapeutic situation want access to that material. 

00:02:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right, yeah. 

00:02:00
PETER JENKINS So, this is a situation where the role of the therapist is almost as a custodian of the information and so, the scenarios include access to counsel records by the client, by the police, by solicitors and by the courts. So, here, I suppose the scenario is where the counsellor is reacting to requests by others to this information. 

00:02:35
MIKE SIMMONS So, let's have a look at the first scenario. 

00:02:35
PETER JENKINS Okay. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN I had a client who I saw about three months ago; as it, as it turns out, it looks as if he's becoming increasingly sensitive and suspicious about people talking and writing things about him. I've heard from him just a couple of days ago and he's demanding to see my counselling records to satisfy himself regarding my notes and its contents. 

00:03:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, I, I guess this is the, kind of, issue that's going to strike anxiety, if not terror, into the therapist's heart. What are the issues here? 

00:03:10
PETER JENKINS Well, again, complex, therapeutic, uh, ethical, professional and, and legal issues and it's trying to unpick these, in a way, which might be helpful to, to the therapist. I guess the, the starting point is really the Data Protection Act 1998, which has had a major effect on therapists recording, since it was introduced in 2000. It has to be said that the act is a very complex piece of legislation and, and, from time to time, there has been guidance produced by the Information Commissioner's office. And I think it's a brave soul who claims to understand the act in all its complexity. I mean, which really is, uh, it's a very difficult, almost by byzantine, piece of, of legislation. I guess what most therapists will understand, they will have appreciated, is that, prior to the act, that most therapeutic recording probably would have been by hand. Um, and it would've been inaccessible, by and large, to clients. So it, it was a private activity. Clients would not, perhaps, be aware that therapists were recording or, if they were recording, what the nature of those records were and, by and large, unless they were computerized, they didn't have access to, to those records of therapy. Now, the Data Protection Act, very briefly, changed all of that at a stroke. So, what it introduced was the principle, which, I think, as therapists we, we understand and we work to, which is that our recording is accountable. That is, that there is the principle of client access; by and large, clients have access to records of therapy. It's not complete, again, there may be a misunderstanding. Not all clients can access all their records; there are some exceptions. And, but that any recording that we do as therapists has to be undertaken with the expectation that the client may want to read it at some stage and may, may be entitled to, to have a copy. So, I guess here, the therapist is concerned as to, partly what is the, the mood or the emotional state of the client who seems to be quite worried, um, perhaps a little bit paranoid. I suppose, in a bizarre way, they, they're quite right. People are writing things about them. The therapist is writing things, uh, is recording the content, but maybe there the client is, has more anxieties about what is in the nature of the records then perhaps would, uh, could be justified. Again, I guess there's a gap between our common sense practice as, as therapists and the, kind of, language that Data Protection law uses, which is unfamiliar and, kind of, can feel a bit clunky to us. I think as therapists, usually the kind of recording that we do we tend to define by its purpose. So it may be, for example, that we have certain records and we think, well, these are for supervision, these are records that identify issues on update to supervision and then, then we might say, well, their records then, these are for the agency; these are records that the agency requires me to do. If we're students, there may be records that we keep for training purposes and, and then maybe, uh, personal development recording, that we also do. Say well, I keep a personal journal and sometimes I reflect on my client work. So, there is a whole gamut of recording, if you like, that we do as therapists, which is defined by purpose. The Data Protection Act takes very different view and it defines the records that we keep, not by their purpose, but by their structure and by their format. And that, that may sound slightly strange. The structure is determined in terms of, partly, again, going back to the original point, where we work. So, there are certain kinds of records, health, education, social work records, which clients, by and large, have access to. In terms of the format of the record, then the key question is, are the records manual, hand-written, or are they electronic. And, of course, electronic includes videotapes and audio tapes. It's very all-embracing. And then, within that, manual records are subdivided, I'm sorry if this gets too technical, into records which are part of what is called a relevant filing system. They're very highly systematic. It's almost as if they were a computerized record, but in paper form. So you could sift through them very quickly, retrieve information on clients; um, anybody, any temporary secretary could go through the records and very quickly retrieve information, almost by pressing a button, you know. Or they're records, which are simply kept in the therapist's own particular style, in no particular order, but the therapist can make sense of them, but anybody else would have difficulty in, in, kind of, finding the information that they were looking for. So, Data Protection introduces a different way of looking at records and that, it presents quite a level of complexity for organizations to make sense of this. Uh, on the one hand, there are records, as I say, which relate to education, health, social work settings, there are records which, if we, if they're computerized, electronic in form, by in large, the client does have access to those. If the, the manual records that we keep, if they're in a relevant filing system, they're very systematized then the cl-, again, the client has access. However, if we have records which are kept in a very idiosyncratic way, only the therapist can really make sense of them, particularly in private practice, then the client does not have access to them. So, the range of different situations and, I mean, it can be as complex as you wish it to be. If you work in a public authority, say a University, then the client does have access to your unstructured records. So, it, it really is quite, um, a, kind of, patchwork quilt of entitlements. 

00:09:50
MIKE SIMMONS Can I just check with you, when you're talking about, um, it's almost the ease of accessibility. Now, I know a number of therapists who will use a coding system known to them. 

00:10:00
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:10:00
MIKE SIMMONS Uh, but not known to anyone else. But my guess is that that is a structured set of records not an unstructured, cause there is a logic to it or am I wrong? 

00:10:10
PETER JENKINS Well, again, there's a, kind of, complexity about what defines a relevant filing system and, and that definition seems to have changed over time. Initially, it looked as though the Information Commissioner was going for as broad a definition of filing as would make client access very widely, uh, acc-, accessible as a principle. Then there was a court case, the Durant case in 2003 and the courts turned all that on its head. And they said, unless the, the manual records that are kept are kept in a very, very systematic way then basically, the client doesn't have access. The Freedom of Information Act then came in and changed it again. So that if you work in a public authority, the client does have access to unstructured records. I think you can take from this it's, it's a very complex mosaic. Um, I mean, to try to relate this to the client scenario, say this particular client was in a healthcare setting, then they would have a right of access to their records as a health record. So, the counselling records that we, been kept by the, the counsellor would be a subset, if you like, of the client's medical notes. They could be kept separately. Um, the, the counsellor could argue that they contain very sensitive information, that they shouldn't be accessible to each and every member of the, the practice or whatever. So, in principle, the client could access the records. There is provision for health, education and social work records for access to be qualified or even denied, if it would cause serious harm to the client or to a third-party. So, it could be that there is information here, perhaps the, um, the counsellor is considering a diagnosis of paranoia or they are concerned about ideas of reference or that, um, the client's mental health is deteriorating, which they might feel would be unhelpful for the client to have access to. And it would then be for the relevant health practitioner, the general practitioner, or psychiatrist, if there was one, to say, well, yes you can have access to your records, um, but it won't be complete access; some information will be retained, because our view is it would cause serious harm. And, of course, client access does not mean access to third-party information. So, it could be there are letters by GPs or, um, other family members or whatever, which the client would not have a right of access to. But, so, there are, there are rights in conflict here. 

00:13:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:13:00
PETER JENKINS The principle is very clearly, was very clearly, in the, the intention of the act that there should be this principle any citizen should have access to information that was being kept on them. Over time, that right seems to have been qualified and diminished, in part, although, in principle it holds true, probably for the vast bulk of recording. And I think, again, where there's a difference between the law, the law may not require us to do something, and a difference between that and professional practice; I think, best professional practice is really to, to write our records in such a way that we ca-, could share them with...(crosstalk) 

00:13:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:13:45
PETER JENKINS ...with clients without embarrassment or without feeling that we, uh, are put on the sport, or having to justify ourselves; that we write in a, in a way which is transparent, and accessible, and accountable. 

00:13:55
MIKE SIMMONS I guess the kind of records I would be most worried about, uh, would be the ones that were much more a, kind of, personal development issue, for me. They would be reflecting on perhaps what the client evokes in me. 

00:14:10
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:14:10
MIKE SIMMONS By me feelings of anger, hostility...(crosstalk) 

00:14:10
PETER JENKINS Yes, yeah. 

00:14:10
MIKE SIMMONS ...whatever. Uh, and that sounds like that's much more likely to fall within the unstructured, uh...(crosstalk) 

00:14:15
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:14:15
MIKE SIMMONS ...category. Cause it's not going to be ‘Tony', you know, and then three pages on Tony...(crosstalk) 

00:14:20
PETER JENKINS Sure, yeah. 

00:14:20
MIKE SIMMONS It's actually going to be my reflections on myself. 

00:14:25
PETER JENKINS Yeah. I, I think that the Data Protection Act presents, presents real challenges to the more subjective, personalized, reflective, intuitive, call it what you will, style of recording that, as therapists we are basically trained and expected and sometimes required to do. So, that, that reflective, almost personal, journaling, exploring well, not what has the client done or what are the outcomes of the therapy, but what does the client evoke in me and what is my, if we choose to use the word counter-transference, or my process...(crosstalk) 

00:15:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:15:00
PETER JENKINS ...or, or whatever. Now, it seems to me there is very limited space within Data Protection guidelines for that, kind of, of recording. One possibility is for that to become part of the official record, particularly if we work in an agency. Now, if that's the case, then the client has access to that very soft, subjective, speculative material. And the agency, perhaps rightly, might feel that that's not an appropriate part of an, a permanent record; that that's much more to do with the individual therapist processing of the material. So, if it's, if that, kind of, personal journaling, that processing or that recording for supervision purposes is not really appropriate as part of the permanent record, then where does it go? Some have suggested that it could be kept as a, kind of, temporary record, which is used by the therapist. So, for example, you record your, your doubts, or your concerns, or your anxieties about the client or your work, you take that to supervision and discuss it with supervision and then, once it's served its purpose, your destroy it. 

00:16:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:16:20
PETER JENKINS Because one of the Data Protection principles, which I think is quite supportive of counsellor recording, is that records should be, they should be fit for purpose. Uh, they should be kept no longer than is necessary, which raises all sorts of interesting...(crosstalk) 

00:16:35
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:16:35
PETER JENKINS ...questions. Well, what is fit for purpose, if you like? Although, strictly speaking, that's not a principal, I think that's the ethos of Data Protection. They should be relevant, they should be accurate, um, and kept no longer than is necessary. Well, you could argue on that basis that having served a purpose in supervision, that your musings about the client from last week, last month, last year, are no longer relevant...(crosstalk) 

00:17:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:17:05
PETER JENKINS ...no longer necessary. That you've hopefully processed that, you've resolved it. Arguably, they would provide very little useful function as part of an ongoing permanent record by the agency of your work with that, that particular client. 

00:17:20
MIKE SIMMONS Now, I know one therapist who keeps no notes. 

00:17:25
PETER JENKINS Right, okay, that's, uh, that is a very interesting stance. Um, I think, increasingly that it's one that agencies possibly would be unhappy with. I don't know if that particular therapist is in, is in private practice. From an ethical and professional point-of-view, there has been a substantial shift on this issue by, for example, the BACP, that the ethical framework, when it came out in, in 2000 said that client's did have the op-, counsellors did have the option of not keeping records. They, they can keep records or not keep records. The more recent version of it in 2010 says that counsellors are advised or encouraged, I don't know the exact wording, to keep records. So, there has been a shift away from this notion that counsellors could, I suppose, be seen to be fully professional, um, without keeping any records. So, it's an individual choice, but it's perhaps a more exposed position...(crosstalk) 

00:18:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:18:35
PETER JENKINS ...for a therapist to be in. Most agencies would have a requirement and maybe part of the contract of employment, you will keep records as directed by the agency. If you don't then, obviously, um, that would be something the agency would take up with you. And private practice, I guess you could choose not to, but how that might be perceived...(crosstalk) 

00:18:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:18:55
PETER JENKINS ...by your professional association could be a different story. I mean, there is a, kind of, a rather solitary story from the Health Professions Council which was going to regulate counselling psychotherapy, but is longer; they do regulate psychologists and in 2010 a clinical psychologist was disciplined, was in fact struck off for failing to keep adequate records. Um, so there is a bit of a store in the wind there that the expectation increasingly is on professionals to be accountable, in terms of the record keeping. 

00:19:30
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, shall we look at another scenario? 

00:19:30
PETER JENKINS Sure, yes. 

00:19:35
MIKE SIMMONS I've just heard from the police. They're demanding access to my counselling files around an active pedophile who was once a client of mine and they're going to prosecute him for offenses against young people. 

00:19:50
MIKE SIMMONS Great bit of acting there, I thought. So, what are the issues? 

00:19:55
PETER JENKINS Well, here we have a situation where the, the counsellor is a custodian of very sensitive client information. And the police have their role to fulfill in upholding the law and prosecuting alleged offenders and if they, in this case it seems that they have amassed evidence that the former client is or was an active pedophile and they, they want to bring a criminal prosecution. Now, the police need to build a case and it may be that they either suspect or they, um, informed that there was information in your files as a counsellor, which would be very, very relevant, very helpful to them in producing evidence, uh, against this, this particular individual. The police themselves don't have legal authority simply to seize your files. The police can be very persuasive in putting their case to counsellors in order to, to gain access to, to files and, and records. And I'll put it no more strongly than that, but strictly speaking, counselling records have a particular legal defense against police seizure. And again, possibly not that widely known, but under Section 12 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 the, the police cannot simply seize counselling records however much they may be convinced that they have a, a valuable function to play in terms of evidence against, uh, an alleged offender. In order to, to gain access to the counsellor's records, they have to get a warrant. So, they would have to go to a circuit judge, who's a, a fairly senior figure in the legal establishment, make out their case and obtain a warrant. Now, of course, if the police obtain a warrant, then you have to supply them with the, the information...(crosstalk) 

00:22:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:22:15
PETER JENKINS ...they, that they want. And it could be that their search would be quite thorough. So, it's not simply that they want this particular, if it's a documentary file, a hand-written file, they might well, reasonably take away your, the, the hard drive of your computer...(crosstalk) 

00:22:30
MIKE SIMMONS Really? 

00:22:30
PETER JENKINS ... if you have information on your PC. So, and, of course, it, common sense would suggest that you, you make a list of all the things that the police decide to take away and you get a signature as to what they have requisitioned. So, the warrant is their legal authority, but without the warrant, they don't have the power, on their own terms, simply to come and get your, your records. So, there is a, kind of, gray area here and I think, as counsellors, we may be quite, I don't know, on the one hand, quite deferential to, to authority and think, well, we have to comply with the police. On the other hand, we might think, well, these are my records and I'm going to stand on confidentiality and not surrender them, which would be, I suppose, quite a, a principled stand, but it's very important that we know what the legal situation is in order to be able to, to, uh, either comply with the warrant or to be able to, to defend, um, client confidentiality, as required. 

00:23:35
MIKE SIMMONS But I think what you said about the warrant is going to be quite eye-opening for a lot of people watching...(crosstalk) 

00:23:45
PETER JENKINS Right. 

00:23:45
MIKE SIMMONS ...this program, including myself. The idea of the whole hard drive, very nearly, you mean the computer really, right? 

00:23:50
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:23:50
MIKE SIMMONS So that all one's records, all one's files would be gone for a period of time. 

00:23:55
PETER JENKINS Well, I, I guess this is a technical issue but, I mean, if there were client records on your hard drive, in addition to or as an alternative to any hand-written records that you had, then the police will be empowered to, um, to seize any relevant records and, of course, it may take them some time to go through the hard drive of the, the PC in order to, uh, determine which records were relevant and which were not. Um, I mean, there is case law on this. I mean, interestingly, the, um, which is, is quite local in nature. There was a case, um, I think, in the early 90s where the police wanted access to psychiatric records. There was, uh, a murder which commit-, which was committed quite close to a mental hospital, a psychiatric hospital, and the police wanted access to records of all the male patients who'd been resident in the hospital at that time in order to, as the phrase goes, to eliminate them from their inquiries. So they approached the psychiatrist and the psychiatrist took a stand on medical confidentiality and refused to comply with the police request. And so, the police took him to court. It went to the, uh, uh, the County Court and the psychiatrist argued his case on medical confidentiality and, surprisingly perhaps, won the case. 

00:25:25
MIKE SIMMONS Wow. 

00:25:30
PETER JENKINS So, there is case law, which defends, if you like, medical confidentiality against police access. Now, I mean, clearly counselling confidentiality is not the same as psychiatric medical confidentiality, but arguably, it's in similar kinds of territory. So, it's interesting that there is some, kind of, case law. The police can be very persistent, if they believe that individuals have information, which will be helpful to their inquiries. And there is, of course, the, the Winter Comfort case, which is, is not, strictly speaking, a counselling case, but I think has some relevance for counsellors. And the, the Winter Comfort case was a hostel in Cambridge for homeless people. And the police were convinced that there was drug dealing, substantial drug dealing going on within the hostel. So, they made an approach to the management committee of Winter Comfort to gain access to, there was a book, I think it was the, the red book, which was a list of all the, the hostel residents who'd been expelled or denied access to the hostel for suspected or proven drug dealing. And the management committee took a stand on confidentiality and they said, their view was, if we give you this information, then our reputation amongst homeless people in the area will be very...(crosstalk) 

00:27:00
MIKE SIMMONS Of course. 

00:27:00
PETER JENKINS ...severely damaged, because homeless people coming into the hostel, uh, will know that any information they disclose or that, that we, if we perceive them involved in any, kind of, drug dealing, that that information will be passed on to the police and, and we won't be able to do our work. And the police were not, well, satisfied with that response and what they did was to send in two undercover police officers. They did a substantial amount of convert surveillance and videoing of the drug dealing that was, perhaps inevitably, going on within the hostel, which the management committee and the workers said that they had done their utmost to try to contain and to, uh, to monitor. And then they brought a prosecution against, um, hostel residents who they allege were involved in, in drug dealing on the premises. But, surprisingly, they also prosecuted two of the hostel workers. And this prosecution was on the grounds that they had knowingly permitted the drug dealing to take place on the hostel...(crosstalk) 

00:28:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:28:15
PETER JENKINS ...premises. Now, the, the case went to court and both of the hostel work-, workers, um, it was John Brock and Ruth Wyner, were convicted and sent to jail. So, their stance was, if you like, one of defense of confidentiality and they were not prepared to break confidentiality. And they paid for it with a criminal conviction and a prison sentence. They appealed against their conviction, they both spent substantial time, uh, in, in, in prison, and they were successful in reducing the sentence, but not in overturning the conviction. 

00:28:50
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:28:55
PETER JENKINS So, this, this may seem to be of limited relevance to counsellors but I, I think there is. Um, it's certainly a very solitary warning that the police can be absolutely determined to obtain evidence and, in some cases, that may conflict with very strong held principles of confidentiality. In this case, they were hostel workers, not counsellors. 

00:29:15
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:29:15
PETER JENKINS But, I mean, one can imagine a situation where the people in the firing line may well be therapists. 

00:29:20
MIKE SIMMONS And once the police have a warrant, then it feels like there's much less room to maneuver. 

00:29:25
PETER JENKINS Absolutely, I mean, if, if they have a warrant, then they have legal authority and you ha-, you must comply with that. 

00:29:30
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Shall we move on to another scenario? 

00:29:35
PETER JENKINS Sure, yes. 

00:29:35
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN I work at the GP practice and I have a client who's suing one of the GPs in the same surgery for negligence. It appears that he mistakenly diagnosed her as having reactive depression, whereas, in fact, she has a brain tumor. She's been seeing me for counselling for this depression for the last six weeks. And now I've just heard from the solicitor, who's written to me asking for access to my counselling records, as part of the process of discovery for the forthcoming legal case and I'm not sure where I stand here. 

00:30:10
MIKE SIMMONS This sounds like quite a complex one. What are the issues here? 

00:30:15
PETER JENKINS I think this is becoming a situation which is more and more familiar to, to counsellors. I mean, not that it's an easy one to, to negotiate, um, but it seems that solicitors are becoming more and more interested in counselling records, or the experience of clients having been for counselling. So, I, I think probably, many counsellors will have the experience of getting a letter from a solicitor and that heart-stopping moment thinking...(crosstalk) 

00:30:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:30:45
PETER JENKINS ...‘Oh my goodness, what is this, uh, how do I respond to this, um, do I have any choices, what are the options? And I suppose the, the starting point is that the solicitor, on their own, doesn't have the legal authority to access your, your client's counselling notes; that the, the solicitor may well be part of a legal process, but they don't have, if you like, a, kind of, legal authority on their own to do this. So, it may be that, for the therapist even to say, well, um, I'm not gonna give you the counselling records for this particular client. I mean, conceivably, that's a breach of confidentiality. You're actually confirming that this person has had...(crosstalk) 

00:31:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:31:30
PETER JENKINS ...counselling, um, which, uh, I mean, I would, uh, you're, you're not necessarily re-, required to do. The, the usual scenario is where a solicitor writes this, kind of, very imposing letter on formal letterhead using...(crosstalk) 

00:31:45
MIKE SIMMONS I've seen them. 

00:31:45
PETER JENKINS ...legal language and, and so on, and they indicate that the client has given their consent to the release of, and often it's a, kind of, blanket phrase so, it's all medical health and, and counselling records. Now, this is actually a root of access, which is through the Data Protection Act. Cause, one of the scenarios that we look at, we've established that, by and large, clients have access to counselling records through the Data Protection Act, Section seven and eight. So, where the solicitor is relying on that, then the client will have given their consent and the solicitor is acting as their legal representative. Now, very often it seems to be that the client is wanting to access their records for the solicitor to use in legal proceedings. I mean, and this can be for a whole range of purposes, it might be to, to prosecute in the case of alleged, uh, abuse, it might be for compensation for whiplash in a, in a car crash, or it might be for workplace stress, there's a whole range of possibilities here. So, the solicitor, if they have cli-, client consent, that's a legitimate request and the counsellor has to respond to this. That's assuming that the client has a right of access to the records under the Data Protection Act. 

00:33:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:33:20
PETER JENKINS Now, the one thing that can make the counsellor quite unpopular at this point is to point out that the client may not have a right of access. 

00:33:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:33:30
PETER JENKINS I mean, they need to be sure of the grounds and that. There are limited grounds on, whereby the, the client doesn't actually have a right of access. But assuming that they do, then the, the counsellor has to comply with this and they need to either send the records in hard copy to the solicitor, as the client's legal representative, they may arrange with the, the client for the client to see them. Again, that, that's a, a, another provision for, for client access. But, essentially those records then become potential evidence for the solicitor in the, the legal case that's proceeding. A lot of counsellors feel very uneasy at this point, because the records are very personal, very sensitive, they're therapeutic records that probably never intended for use as evidence in legal proceedings. And, I think, a lot of therapists at this point, often feel the need to double check with the client; to see whether the client understands that the records contain often very sensitive information, that the information will be disclosed, not simply to their solicitor, but also to the opposing solicitors...(crosstalk) 

00:34:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:34:45
PETER JENKINS ...in the criminal or the civil case. And clients often do not fully appreciate that. And that the material may either be of very limited relevance or it could actually be potentially damaging or harmful to the client. So, I, some counsellors say, well, what I would want to do at this point, is call the client in and say, do they understand the potential uses of the material and to get their informed consent to the disclosure. Now, this might be defensible and ethical in professional terms, but it's liable to get very short thrift from the solicitor. Because if the solicitor has the client's consent, then the records have to be disclosed. 

00:35:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right, yes. 

00:35:30
PETER JENKINS So, the records by then are then fed into a legal process and I have heard of situations where, if the client begins to have second thoughts and, uh, says, well, I'm not sure I want this to go ahead. Then the solicitor may even say, well, unless you consent to disclosure in use of the records, then the legal action will not be able to go ahead. So, having reached that point, the client is conceivably in a position of losing some, kind of, control over their process. 

00:36:00
MIKE SIMMONS So the wheels have started in motion by the moment the client gives consent at the beginning. 

00:36:05
PETER JENKINS That's right, yes and I, and I think, very often clients don't fully realize that the records through the process of, of disclosure, this is a legal process whereby the evidence, which may be supports their claim for workplace stress, will also be disclosed to the legal representatives of their employer. Now, of course, in that kind of situation it's an adversarial process. The, the client may be very interested in the therapist records, which may be referred to the, uh, the client's anxiety or stress or depression or whatever their complaints about pressures at work. Equally, the employer, their representatives will be very interested in any other contextual material...(crosstalk) 

00:36:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:37:00
PETER JENKINS ...about, uh, pre-existing conditions. It may be that the client was anxious before, they have a history of, um, alcohol dependency or drug dependency, that they, um, have ongoing marital or relationships stressors because, of course, all that, kind of, information is of enormous value to those defending a potential claim against...(crosstalk) 

00:37:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:37:25
PETER JENKINS ...workplace stress because it tends to suggest that any stress that the, the client is alleging arise, which arose in the workplace, actually had other sources. So...(crosstalk) 

00:37:35
MIKE SIMMONS So...(crosstalk) 

00:37:35
PETER JENKINS ...it could in fact, validate, or diminish, or weaken the client's claim. 

00:37:40
MIKE SIMMONS So both parties, both party solicitors will be looking at the same notes...(crosstalk) 

00:37:50
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:37:50
MIKE SIMMONS ...through a very different lens, looking for a different things. 

00:37:50
PETER JENKINS Absolutely. 

00:37:50
MIKE SIMMONS One looking for evidence that the thing, the event caused the stress, or whatever. 

00:37:55
PETER JENKINS Sure. 

00:37:55
MIKE SIMMONS The other's looking like there was a pre-disposition ...(crosstalk) 

00:38:00
PETER JENKINS Yes. Yes. 

00:38:00
MIKE SIMMONS ...or a previous history of that. 

00:38:00
PETER JENKINS Yeah and I think what clients don't fully appreciate is that the, the legal system is highly adversarial, so that yes, the, the client will be wanting to amass evidence, um, for example, maybe to support a criminal prosecution of an alleged abuser in the past, or to bring a prosecution for alleged sexual assault, for example, but equally, the defendant will be wanting access to medical, or health, or counselling records for any information that might weaken or invalidate the credibility of the client as a credible witness. 

00:38:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right. Are there some more issues around this one? I think it goes a bit further? 

00:38:45
PETER JENKINS Yes, it does. So, um, I mean, this is really at, I suppose, the early stages, where the records, um, are being requested or there's a request for, for client access, which is mediated by this solicitor. Now, the other route of access is not through Data Protection and I think, as counsellors we often get his slightly confused , that client access is really through the Data Protection Act. The other route of access is through the courts. And apart from the solicitor making a request or getting client consent for, for counselling records. The other major route of access to counselling records is by court order. So, the courts can require access to, effectively, any counselling record, any material that the counsellor has on a particular client, whether in the past or currently. And this has, obviously, the force of law and it must be complied with. So, that as counsellors we do not possess what is called privilege. Privilege would be the legal right to refuse to hand over our records, to refuse to be a witness in a court of law on the grounds that that would diminish the client's confidentiality. Interestingly, therapists in America and some social workers in America, do have legal privilege. So, they have this fortunate position, if it is a fortunate position, where they can refuse a court order or a witness summons. And, uh, I would imagine probably in the U.K., many counsellors would be very, um ...(crosstalk) 

00:40:30
MIKE SIMMONS ...pleased to have that. 

00:40:35
PETER JENKINS Very envious of this position. The, the only group that has purveyed this legal, professional privilege as, uh, as a group of counsellors are those involved in marital and relationship counselling. There are some obscure bits of case law which apply, which are used fairly frequently by organizations, like Relate, when the court's try to subpoena records...(crosstalk) 

00:40:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:40:55
PETER JENKINS ...of their clients. Then they dust off these particular bits of case law from the 1940s, 1950s and argue the case for, um, for matrimonial privilege and, uh, the courts reluctantly concede that, uh, yes, that these records, um, do have that level of protection. The, the reason being, it may seem a little bit obscure but, of course, when clients or couples go to, it used to be the probation service, or to marriage guidance, or Relate, very often, in discussing their marital issues, they might be also looking at legal processes like separation or dividing up property; so the principle was established that, within marital relationship counselling, there were areas which really should not be enforced as accessible, within a court of law. So, those kinds of very sensitive discussions should have a degree of protection. I suppose similar to protection that, um, solicitor's clients have. So that solicitor's clients have privilege and, uh, they, those discussions with their solicitor cannot be forced, um, to be made accessible to a court. 

00:42:15
MIKE SIMMONS It, it's interesting, looking back to when I was trained as a counsellor, I'm pretty sure I remember being told, I certainly remember hearing, differently...(crosstalk) 

00:42:25
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:42:25
MIKE SIMMONS ...um, that the client/counsellor confidentiality was very much like that of a priest, that it was protected. Whether that was spurious then, it's certainly spurious now. 

00:42:35
PETER JENKINS Well, I'm, I'm afraid to disillusion you, but, yes, I mean, the, uh, in fact, priests don't have privilege. 

00:42:45
MIKE SIMMONS Oh, there you go. 

00:42:45
PETER JENKINS So, I mean, there, again, obscure case law dating back to Victorian times that priests can be made to give evidence in a court of law. They, they cannot claim that, um, it would be a breach of confidentiality. And, of course, the same applies to doctors and to counsellors. Uh, one could take a stance on counselling confidentiality and refuse to, to, to give evidence, but, of course, the, the risk is that you would be judged to be in contempt of court. 

00:43:10
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:43:15
PETER JENKINS And you might then spend a period of time reflecting on your decision in, in the cells. So... 

00:43:20
MIKE SIMMONS I'd rather avoid it. 

00:43:20
PETER JENKINS Yes, I mean the courts really, their, their argument is a serious one, which is that, in order to make very important decisions about guilt or innocence, liability and so on, the courts need access to the full range of information that is available. So that the, the court's interest, if you like, the public interest in the courts having access to information, overrides confidentiality. Um, so, we, we, we, we can't really stand on confidentiality in order to prevent access to the courts having access to those kinds of counselling records. There are various options and various strategies and, um, one of them is, in some cases, counsellors will offer to write a report for the court or the solicitor, uh, will request a report. And this can seem an attractive option so that the, the therapist, perhaps, can limit the disclosure or very sensitive and, perhaps, irrelevant information; that they can in-, inform the court to the, the nature of the therapy, or the number of sessions or whatever, but still protect, I suppose, the core of the, the therapeutic relationship. So, and that may work, that may be sufficient, in some cases. It does have drawbacks though because, of course, as therapists, we're not trained in writing court reports. So, unless we've had a prior professional training; I remember as a trainee social worker writing court reports and you were trained within an inch of your life how to write, uh, a cogent report, what was fact, what was opinion, uh, what was relevant, what was not relevant and you got a very dusty response from your supervisor or from the magistrates if you included material that wasn't relevant. So, I, some professionals may have that training; by and large, as therapists, we don't. We could write something that's pretty good, that's a pretty good, uh, report and it goes to your, it goes to court and is torn to shreds, because it doesn't following the protocols, it mixes fact with opinion, um, it's simply not what the court requires for its decision-making. And if the intention was to protect our original records from access, it may fail because the court may say, well, thank you very much for the report, now can we have the records on which the report was based? 

00:45:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:45:55
PETER JENKINS And, again, you would have to comply with that. 

00:45:55
MIKE SIMMONS Go back to square one. 

00:45:55
PETER JENKINS So, as a strategy, it does have some merit, but it's, uh, again, it may open the door to the very thing the therapist is seeking to, uh, to avoid; that is, disclosing the, the original confidential reports. The other element to this is that the therapist may conceivably be called as a witness. So, it could be that in addition to the disclosure of the therapy records, perhaps, in addition to a report, that the court may issue a summons and the therapist would be required to, to go to court as a witness to, to attest to the nature of the contact with the client, to answer questions in terms of the frequency of contact, the nature of the, the issues and so on. Now, again, the, the court has full authority in requiring therapists to do that and as therapists, we, we don't have privilege, you can't refuse. Although there is the case of Anne Hayman. Anne Hayman was a therapist who, for professional reasons, declined to act as a witness in a court of law, which was, um, really quite a high-risk strategy. Her argument was that she was a, a psychoanalytic psychotherapist and she was called in relation to one of her former clients. And she, she went to court, but declined to even acknowledge that the person in the dock...(crosstalk) 

00:47:30
MIKE SIMMONS Of course. 

00:47:30
PETER JENKINS ...had been her client, cause that would be a breach of confidentiality; and, moreover, declined to answer any question about the person in the dock, who may or may not have been her client. And the judge, not unreasonably, pointed out that if she refused to do this that she would be in contempt of court. And she said she understood this and she was quite prepared to accept the consequences. And, I mean, the judge had obviously never come across anyone who'd, uh, been quite this, uh, sort of, uh, strident in their defense of confidentiality before and was very curious and wanted to know what was the, the basis for this. And she said because she worked on the basis of transference; that if she was to disclose any information about the client that it would impact in a negative way on the transference and it would undo any therapeutic work that she'd managed to achieve with the person, who may or may not have been the person in the dock. Well, the judge had obviously never heard of transference...(crosstalk) 

00:48:35
MIKE SIMMONS Transference. 

00:48:35
PETER JENKINS ...and was obviously very bemused by this and thought and eventually came back and said, well, but surely if you had the, the permission of a client, who may or may not be the person in the dock, then, um, that would resolve this issue. And, quick as a flash, Anne Hayman came back and said, well, in fact, that would be worse because this would be an example of positive transference and would, you know, again impact in very negative ways on the, uh, on the therapeutic process. Well, I guess the judge was receiving an education in, in therapeutic language, transference, positive, negative or whatever and in the end said, well, okay, you can stand down. So, unfortunately, it's not a legal precedent, but, I mean, as an exemplar; I mean, I've met, I've met Anne Hayman and spoken with her. I mean, she's, uh, very resolute in her defense of therapeutic confidentiality. But it's not a precedent that we can quote unfortunately. It was simply that the judges, I think they decided that, um, discretion was probably the better part of judicial procedure in this particular case. 

00:49:50
MIKE SIMMONS Wonderful example of the, sort of, impact between the world of therapy and the world of law. 

00:49:50
PETER JENKINS Absolutely, I mean, um, the, the judge struggling to understand and there are, there are other cases where concepts like transference and counter-transference have been very, kind of, studiously looked at by judges and they've tried to make sense of them and apply them in, in, uh, particular judgments, but there is a sense of, I suppose, alien worlds coming into contact here. There is, finally, there is one way in which therapists who have real concerns about therapeutic material being disclosed within a, a legal arena and being potentially damaging for clients. There is, uh, a way which they can attempt to limit disclosure and this is been used quite successfully by BACP in a number of cases. And this is where the therapist, if they have an, an order to disclose records or they have a witness summons to appear as a witness, that they can approach the judge, and this has to be done in a, in a very formal and appropriate legal way, for the judge, for example, to, to go through the records of therapy in chambers and for the judge to decide which bits are relevant and which bits are not relevant. Cause, obviously, from a legal point-of-view, court hearings are very expensive and the court has no interest in wasting time on irrelevant material. So, if the judge would agree to this, that they would go through the therapy records and they say, right, this is the information that we want, this is directly relevant, this other material is of no relevance to the court. Then in a sense, that, um, the, the exposure of, kind of, very, very embarrassing, very sensitive, irrelevant material, quite damaging, perhaps, too, to the client, uh, could, could be limited. The catch is that the therapist can't simply write to the judge themselves. It has to be done through, through a barrister and, of course, the question then is, well, who pays...(crosstalk) 

00:52:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. 

00:52:05
PETER JENKINS ...for this? It's a legal process. BACP did manage to raise this as an issue, um, some time ago and, I think, most therapists will find, if they read the small print in their professional indemnity insurance policies, there is provision for legal cover, uh, and, in some cases, legal representation for a case to be made to limit disclosure on the grounds of confidentiality. 

00:52:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:52:30
PETER JENKINS So, it's, it's a strategy, which is worth pursuing and has been successful in some cases. Obviously, at the end of the day, if the courts decide they want either access to your records or if they want you as a witness, then you have to comply. There, there, there's no contesting that, but it may be that the judge can be persuaded, if it's done in the appropriate manner, that the records really are not relevant, there, there's very little or that there's nothing in there which is actually gonna help the court in their deliberations. 

00:53:05
MIKE SIMMONS Peter, we're coming to the end of the program now. Any final thing you need to say, want to say, before we finish? 

00:53:10
PETER JENKINS Well, I think, to add a caveat about my responses to the scenarios, if that, unless that sounds slightly, uh, self-contradictory, that it is my experience as therapists, we do look to the law for absolute certainty . And people will often say, well, what can I do in this situation? Is it this or is it that? And, quite often, I think, as therapists, we're phased by being told, well, there's a number of possibilities here. As I said, it depends on the client group, it depends on the context, it depends on your employment situation as to what the options are. And that in any legal situation, you can almost guarantee there are gonna be two, possibly, three different responses, depending upon who you ask and what their perspective is on that situation. So, my answers need to be taken in context. This is my view...(crosstalk) 

00:54:05
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:54:10
PETER JENKINS ...my perspective; it is not legal advice. It's to be, it's, uh, if you like, a perspective that's developed over a number of years of study, and discussion, and research. It's as accurate as I can reasonably make it to be. Others may well have different views, in terms of legal responsibilities. And I guess that's in the nature of the law. That in any situation, you have at least two di-, opposing points-of-view, otherwise people would never go to court. We'd simply look it up...(crosstalk) 

00:54:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:54:40
PETER JENKINS ...in a book and the answer would be there. 

00:54:45
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Peter, thank you very much. 

00:54:45
PETER JENKINS thank you. 

00:54:45
MIKE SIMMONS Very helpful.
