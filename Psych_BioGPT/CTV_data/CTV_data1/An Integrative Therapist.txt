BEGIN TRANSCRIPT 

00:00:00
This is the second session that Els and Norma recorded together. The first couldn't be used for technical reasons. 

00:00:10
In that first session Norma talked about her bereavement following the death of her husband Ron. This session was recorded several months later. 

00:00:20
ELS Hi, Norma. 

00:00:20
NORMA Hi. 

00:00:20
ELS Really nice to see you. 

00:00:25
NORMA Thank you. 

00:00:25
ELS Yeah. It's been a little while, hasn't it? 

00:00:25
NORMA And you. Yes. Yeah, yeah. So this is a bit more of an unexpected meeting. 

00:00:35
ELS Yeah, expected. 

00:00:35
NORMA Unexpected. 

00:00:35
ELS Unexpected, yes. 

00:00:35
NORMA 'Cause I thought we had… 

00:00:40
ELS We had a session. 

00:00:40
NORMA Yeah, we did the business. And so it's a return visit and… wondering what it was that I would like to talk about this time, you know. 

00:00:55
[sil.] 

00:01:00
NORMA And I'm still not ever so sure what that will be. But I… I woke this morning, as I usually do, fairly early. And not long after that the birds started to sing and I was listening to them and the birds, I could hear some really closer. And then in the distance there were birds that were replying to the song. 

00:01:35
ELS Oh, answering. Oh, yeah. 

00:01:35
NORMA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:01:35
ELS And that's so nice, isn't it? 

00:01:35
NORMA And there was a wood… wood pigeon there as well. What the other birds were, I have no idea. But I was just listening and then not the same how I was drifting away from that. that I… I don't know whether I wasn't prepared to listen or I couldn't stay in that moment. But I kept on drifting off into thinking, oh, I've got to do this for work or have I made this phone call or what will this morning be like. 

00:02:00
ELS Oh. Exactly. 

00:02:05
NORMA You know. 

00:02:05
ELSE Yeah. 

00:02:05
NORMA And then coming back to the song, the song birds. and… It sort of, umm… I don't know if it's a prompt or an invitation to what, perhaps I'd like to look at as, what was happening in that moment, difficulty I have of staying in the here and now. And how I find so many ways of dodging that. And I've become aware of this over the last few months. 

00:02:45
ELS Have you? 

00:02:45
NORMA And… And how I resist and how I back away from… 

00:02:55
ELS From the present? 

00:02:55
NORMA From the moment, you know. 

00:02:55
ELS It reminds me of what we talked about last time. Because I think you were just about beginning to engage with mindfulness. 

00:03:05
NORMA Yes. Yes. 

00:03:05
ELS Yeah. And of course, that's exactly what it is. 

00:03:05
NORMA Yes. Yeah. 

00:03:10
ELS How difficult it is for all of us to stay in the present moment, yeah. 

00:03:15
NORMA Yeah. Such a lovely idea. 

00:03:15
ELS Yeah. 

00:03:15
NORMA But the more I try, the more I dig my heels in. And it's a real tension and it's not that I've begun to notice, is the reluctance to be in the moment. 

00:03:30
[sil.] 

00:03:35
NORMA I think you might remember, there was a, an eclipse of the moon this week. 

00:03:40
ELS Yes, I missed it. I didn't know until the next day, such a shame. Did you see it? 

00:03:45
NORMA I did. I stayed up and I wanted to see it. It was something about I might never have a chance to see it again, you know, 'cause it's not gonna come back until 2033 or something. 

00:04:00
ELS Oh, is it? 

00:04:00
NORMA And I just desperately wanted it, you know, to see it. 

00:04:00
ELS Yeah. 

00:04:05
NORMA So I set my alarm and I woke an hour before. So I was there watching it. And as the, you know, as it was happening and then it turned into this big red color, you know. 

00:04:20
ELS Fantastic, wow. The moon was big red? 

00:04:20
NORMA Yes. It was fascinating, you know. And the stars, they were brilliant and the sky as well. And I… And I wanted to keep that moment, so I took a picture of it, you know. 

00:04:35
ELS You did? And with you time. 

00:04:35
NORMA Well, it was my mobile, you know. I thought, I'll have it forever then, you know. And wanted to stay with that and then looking at the picture in the morning and it wasn't anything like I had seen it in… in that moment. 

00:04:55
ELS Yeah. 

00:05:00
NORMA And then, you know, this Indian summer that we're having, you know. 

00:05:00
ELS Yeah. 

00:05:05
NORMA From my garden, I can see, from my back window, I see the sun rising and I see it setting. 

00:05:10
ELS Fantastic. 

00:05:15
NORMA And they've been brilliant, you know. 

00:05:15
ELS They have, yeah. 

00:05:15
NORMA And it's that same thing, wanting to grab it and keep it, and just be there and both wanting to run from it as well, there's… 

00:05:30
ELS So continuous movement of really wanting to be there and really appreciating and holding on to it? 

00:05:35
NORMA Yeah. 

00:05:35
ELS And moving away? 

00:05:40
NORMA Moving away. 

00:05:40
ELS Yeah. 

00:05:40
NORMA And I think, I saw it, it was on Sunday. And I'm quite high up and I overlook the sea. And I just peeped at the window and I… I saw it was sunset and the colors, the… the reds, and the orange, and the gold, and the… the grays, all. And it was one of those sunsets, it just wasn't in front of you, it was right around you to string like in the sky. 

00:06:10
ELS Yeah, yeah. 

00:06:10
NORMA You know, and I was… And I didn't know what to do with that, I just wanted to capture it and be with it. But as much as I wanted it, there was a sensation, just go in, you know, you'll see it again, just go in. 

00:06:30
ELS Don't stay, just go. 

00:06:30
NORMA Just go and… 

00:06:35
[sil.] 

00:06:40
NORMA …and I think it's been… it's really come into my awareness that I can't stay in the moment, I've got to run from it. 

00:06:50
ELS How hard it is to be, really, just to be and nothing else. 

00:06:55
NORMA And nothing else. 

00:06:55
ELS And it goes, as soon as you become aware of the moment, the moment's gone. 

00:07:00
NORMA Yes, yeah. 

00:07:00
ELS It's discontinuous. There's no such thing in the way, is that this is continues. I don't know if this helpful at all, but a quote comes into my mind that I remember reading many, many years ago. I don't even know by, who by, some famous philosopher, "Well, the present is a moment we continuously evade." 

00:07:20
NORMA Oh, and that's exactly what I'm doing. 

00:07:25
ELS Yeah, yeah. I think it's (inaudible ). 

00:07:26
NORMA It just captures it. Yeah, I hadn't realized just how deliberately I do it, you know, when I… when I think about it, when I… Other ways that I do it, I talk myself out of it. I busy myself out of it. And… 

00:07:50
ELS And what's… Yeah, so this is something you've become aware of. And… And what does it mean to you, I guess, the fact that those, that resistance, there's that running away? Well, I just noticed that big sigh, yeah. 

00:08:10
[sil.] 

00:08:20
NORMA I know I don't want to look at it right now, (inaudible ). 

00:08:25
[sil.] 

00:08:35
NORMA Is it how far do I go into this, because I think it's something that I'm being invited to do, it's in my awareness and it won't go away, Els, it won't go away. 

00:08:50
ELS So you've been invited? 

00:08:50
NORMA To… 

00:08:50
ELS Where does the invitation come from? 

00:08:55
NORMA Yeah. And why the resistance? Why I evade it? You know, what… what's happening? 

00:09:05
ELS So really wanting it and really not wanting it? 

00:09:05
NORMA Yes, both at the same time, but both are strong. And it's almost physical sometimes. No, it's not almost, it is physical sometimes, the… the… the tension, you know. 

00:09:20
ELS What do you feel when you say it's physical? What… What goes on in your body? 

00:09:25
NORMA My throat tightens and my stomach does… And there's an anxiety and a… and a stress that I feel. And like when I was seeing that sunset, there was such joy at the beauty of it. And it was… it was just… And it, you know, it just wrapped itself around me and then it gotten sort of… 

00:10:00
[sil.] 

00:10:05
NORMA I don't know if it was a peaceful feeling, but it was, there was… The anxiety wasn't there. And then it went… and then I'm back, tight, you know. 

00:10:20
ELS So… 

00:10:20
NORMA What can I… What can I do to get away from this, now whatever I, you know, that gone blue to this (inaudible )? You know, anything… 

00:10:27
ELS Yeah. 

00:10:30
NORMA …get up into my head. 

00:10:30
ELS I'm really struck by how you said, it wrapped itself around me, so it was a lovely feeling, and also what your reaction on how… how wonderful that was. 

00:10:40
NORMA Yeah, yeah. 

00:10:40
ELS And yet not being able to… to stay there. 

00:10:45
NORMA Like… Like silk, and so light and… but unreachable as well, because even as I was watching it, the colors were changing. They're like shimmering, you know. 

00:11:00
ELS Yeah. Yeah, they change all the time. 

00:11:05
NORMA Yeah. It was… 

00:11:10
[sil.] 

00:11:25
NORMA I'm trying to decide, 'cause I think I know… No, I don't think I know what's at the heart of it. 

00:11:30
ELS Ah, okay. 

00:11:30
NORMA And it's where the two dip into it now. I know that it's… 

00:11:40
[sil.] 

00:11:45
NORMA Always pretty clear to me that when I'm being prompted to do the same, look at the same thing. Then it's… then it needs looking at, you know. 

00:12:00
ELS Ah, I see, but at the same thing. What do you mean when you're saying… 

00:12:05
NORMA When I am being… When I'm… when I'm being prompted to look at what's happening in the moment, why am I resisting. And that's not just happened once. It just keeps into my awareness. 

00:12:15
ELS Yeah. 

00:12:20
NORMA It might well have been, this (inaudible ) might well have happen the last time that we… that we met, you know, who am I, what's my… 

00:12:25
ELS That's exactly what's coming to my head just now. But that's what we talked about, "What am I for?" I think you said. 

00:12:35
NORMA Yeah, Yeah. 

00:12:35
ELS What do I do now? 

00:12:35
NORMA Yeah. 

00:12:35
ELS Yeah. Yeah. 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:50
NORMA I spent summer clearing out my roof space. 

00:12:55
[sil.] 

00:13:00
NORMA On a practical level, I had to do it, because I couldn't get in there anymore. And… So I put my mindset, this is the task for the… for the summer. And I knew what to expect. But I didn't know what to expect either. That's 40 years, 40 to 50 years of… 

00:13:30
ELS Oh, really? 

00:13:30
NORMA …stuff up there, you know. 

00:13:30
ELS Wow! So almost like an (inaudible ) there, think. 

00:13:35
NORMA Yeah. 

00:13:40
ELS That's quite something. 

00:13:45
NORMA And… 

00:13:50
ELS So lots of memories. 

00:13:55
NORMA Yeah. My life, my family's life, up there. 

00:14:00
[sil.] 

00:14:05
NORMA And… On a practical level, it was hard craft. 

00:14:15
ELS Oh, I should say. 

00:14:15
NORMA And the guys down at the recycling plant got to know me very well. 

00:14:20
[sil.] 

00:14:25
NORMA And the charity shops, they made up (inaudible ). 

00:14:26
ELS So it all went, or most of it went to charity shops and recycling? 

00:14:30
NORMA Most of it went to recycle. 

00:14:35
ELS Yeah. So, not lost. 

00:14:35
NORMA As it's… In the end, all that was left was just rubbish, really. 

00:14:40
ELS Yeah. 

00:14:45
NORMA That nobody would have wanted, or could have used. 

00:14:45
ELS Yeah. So some… So some of it was… was complete rubbish that nobody wanted, but most of it, it sounds like… What's going to be… have a gentle use, if you like, or be used by others. 

00:15:00
NORMA Yeah. Some of it. I think the rubbish was most. 

00:15:05
ELS Umm… Was it? 

00:15:05
NORMA And there are some that I've kept. 

00:15:05
ELS Okay. 

00:15:10
NORMA And because I just couldn't let go off. 

00:15:15
ELS Do you want to say what you couldn't let go off? Or would you rather not? 

00:15:20
[sil.] 

00:15:45
NORMA The things that belonged to Ron. 

00:15:50
ELS Well, of course. 

00:15:50
NORMA And were… That we shared. And they won't make any sense or have any value to anybody else. 

00:16:05
ELS No. 

00:16:05
NORMA And eventually, they will go to the dump. 

00:16:10
ELS But at the moment they're of value to you. 

00:16:10
NORMA Yeah. Yeah. And some of them I was able to look at because there's, I don't know, there were thousands of pictures. 

00:16:20
ELS Were there? 

00:16:25
NORMA There were boxes of them. Some I couldn't look at. I found a box of the letters we wrote. 

00:16:40
ELS To each other? 

00:16:40
NORMA To each other. And… 

00:16:45
[sil.] 

00:16:50
NORMA So I know what they are. 

00:16:50
ELS Yeah. 

00:16:55
NORMA But I can't look at that. 

00:16:55
ELS No, not yet. 

00:17:00
NORMA Yeah. And some that I didn't know, stuff that Ron had put away, put aside boxes of them, of the work that he was… he was, you know, the profession that he was in, he kept very closely. He had diaries and everything, every bit of work what he did was noted. 

00:17:25
ELS Was it? 

00:17:25
NORMA It was in such detail, you know. 

00:17:25
ELS And you didn't know that? 

00:17:30
NORMA I didn't know that. 

00:17:30
ELS So it was a discovery, something new, you didn't know about. 

00:17:35
NORMA Yeah. And some of the work that he had to produce, you know, he kept copies of them and I thought, "Why didn't I know that?" Why didn't I… Why didn't I bother to find out this part of his life? And… 

00:17:55
ELS And the way you said that, "Why didn't I know that?" How does it feel? What do you feel when you say that? 

00:18:00
NORMA Regret. 

00:18:05
[sil.] 

00:18:10
NORMA The shame that I didn't… 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:20
NORMA …enter into that part of his life more fully, you know. 

00:18:20
ELS His work and how he stood… 

00:18:25
NORMA Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:18:25
ELS …was that make his work. 

00:18:30
NORMA He's a very quiet man, and very unassuming. I haven't realized… 

00:18:40
[sil.] 

00:18:45
NORMA Haven't realized until his funeral, just how many people had… had been touched by him, you know. I never knew so many people knew him. 

00:19:00
[sil.] 

00:19:10
NORMA And clearing out the attic, it just introduced me to somebody that I, or a part of somebody that I didn't know about. And… 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:30
ELS Yeah. 

00:19:30
NORMA And I alternate between feeling really emotional and crying, and… and then crumpling it down and then filling the black bags. And then I'd bring it down the stairs and load into the car. 

00:19:45
ELS Yes. 

00:19:45
NORMA And then throwing it into the dump, you know, and… and really just… and so the guys knew that I was, you know, these bags are (inaudible[00:19.54]), but I won't. Lifting them up and just throwing them in, you know. 

00:20:00
ELS And what did that feel like to do that? It's like something you really needed to do. 

00:20:05
NORMA Yeah. Yeah, angry and… 

00:20:10
[sil.] 

00:20:15
NORMA It was that physical bit again. I just wanted to lift something and throw something as well. 

00:20:20
ELS Yeah. 

00:20:25
[sil.] 

00:20:30
NORMA And each new find, looking upon that, I'd… it would be I'd looked at it and then I'd… 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:20:45
NORMA …start to cry. And then I'd push it back down again. 

00:20:50
ELS Yeah, it's a very painful one, (inaudible ). "Oh, if only I… why didn't I know that?" 

00:20:55
NORMA Yeah. 

00:20:55
ELS Yeah. 

00:21:00
NORMA Yeah. 

00:21:00
ELS But how much do we ever know about some other person, even the person you live with? 

00:21:05
NORMA I guess, in those moments and… and now still at this (inaudible ) I should have known, I ought to have known and if only I'd known, you know, and… and it's too late. 

00:21:25
ELS And if only you'd know, done what? 

00:21:30
NORMA Oh, I could have shared more and be more aware of him. 

00:21:35
[sil.] 

00:21:40
ELS What happened just now, because you, when I asked that question, you said, "I'd be more aware", and you suddenly look down and… What happened? 

00:21:55
NORMA Yeah. It's… I can't change it. 

00:21:55
ELS Yeah. 

00:21:55
NORMA Els, I can't change it. I can sulk and I can scream that I haven't, but I can't change it. All it is, is painful. 

00:22:05
ELS Yeah. 

00:22:10
[sil.] 

00:22:15
NORMA And I think that's why I can't stay in the moment. 

00:22:20
ELS It was just so painful. 

00:22:20
NORMA Yeah. And even sunsets are beautiful, but they are painful. 

00:22:25
ELS They don't stay either. Yeah. 

00:22:30
NORMA They just go. 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:40
ELS But they are beautiful when they… when they are there. 

00:22:45
NORMA And they wrap themselves around me. 

00:22:50
[sil.] 

00:22:55
NORMA And it surf around the way. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:05
NORMA And I find any number of ways of running away. 

00:23:10
ELS And running away from having… something or someone wrap the moment. 

00:23:20
NORMA Yeah. And it's better to do that than have it go. 

00:23:35
ELS To run away rather than having it go away? 

00:23:40
NORMA Rather than lose it and not the loss of it. You know, it's a value of my life. Els, I've gotten on with it, you know. And… 

00:23:55
ELS That you have. 

00:23:55
NORMA But… 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:05
NORMA It's… It's… It's just so painful. And I never expected to be like that, that's all, because I knew so much about it. 

00:24:25
ELS About being… 

00:24:25
NORMA About being protected, you know. I'd figure it out, and I can't figure it out. 

00:24:35
ELS No. 

00:24:35
NORMA I can't figure it out. I can't, I read, you know, I read all the books. I look for new authors who might shed some insight on how I am, you know. A lot and other escape because it's easy to read somebody else. 

00:24:55
ELS Yeah. 

00:25:00
NORMA And face what's happening. 

00:25:05
ELS And then you said, "I've… I've survived my life. I've gotten on with it." I thought, what does that mean? 

00:25:20
NORMA Umm… A work-all I was, I feel each moment. Somebody asked me… 

00:25:25
ELS Yeah. 

00:25:25
NORMA Was it, oh, yeah, last night you know, "What you do other than work?" And I didn't have an answer for it. I had to really struggle to find an answer. And can't stop still. 

00:25:50
ELS So work, whether that's… I guess, your work, or whether it's throwing them, you know, carrying them down and chucking them in. 

00:26:00
NORMA Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me something to do. 

00:26:00
ELS And that's important too. 

00:26:05
NORMA Yeah. It's got… 

00:26:05
ELS Because that place, that is so painful to stay in it the whole time. 

00:26:05
NORMA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:26:10
ELS Yeah. 

00:26:10
NORMA I just worry that it would drown me if I stayed with it. 

00:26:15
ELS Yeah. So maybe there is a need for that, engaging with it, letting the sunset wrap itself around you. And then also might be coming out again, maybe it's in and out. I don't know, I'm just wondering. 

00:26:35
NORMA And not make sense to me, and you know. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:45
NORMA And… I try not to give myself a… a hard time. I don't want to beat myself up (inaudible ). But it's… 

00:26:51
ELS No. It is how it is. 

00:26:55
NORMA Yeah. But why is it when he says to me, why can't I work my way out of it that you know, that… 

00:27:10
ELS Work my way out of it. 

00:27:10
NORMA Yeah, that's how I'd done things in the past, you know, any problem that I have, I worked my way out of it. 

00:27:15
ELS So you solved the problem and… 

00:27:15
NORMA I solved it. 

00:27:15
ELS Yeah. 

00:27:20
NORMA And I can't solve this damn thing. 

00:27:20
ELS No. And it's not that sort of thing, I guess. 

00:27:25
NORMA Should be. 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:35
NORMA So I escape into work and I escape into my head and my thoughts and how I rationalize it and into books and into theory. And that's why I can't stay in the moment, because if I stay in the moment then I have to come out of my head and have to go into my feelings. And that's when I drown. That's when it feels like a tsunami. 

00:28:05
[sil.] 

00:28:10
ELS A tsunami, that's a very, very strong image. 

00:28:15
NORMA Yeah. I… In the early days, I tried to find something that explained to me how it felt. And then saw the… you know, the… the Japanese tsunami and the clips of it on TV, how everything was sucked into the wave. 

00:28:45
ELS Yeah, unstoppable. 

00:28:50
NORMA And the blackness of it. Yeah. And that's what it feels, like I'm swept with all that rubbish and I can't get to the surface, and I am drowning. 

00:29:10
ELS So to stay in that tsunami the whole time, you would… 

00:29:15
NORMA I just couldn't survive. 

00:29:15
ELS Yeah, you will drown. 

00:29:15
NORMA So I come back, I work, I think, I read. I distract myself and I come up. And I… I know, my rational head knows that I survived with this, and it's okay. 

00:29:30
ELS Yes. Yes, of course. 

00:29:30
NORMA But I am, these last few months it's in my head to say because it hasn't decreased. Els, this is raw no, as it was three years ago. Nothing's changed. 

00:29:45
ELS Nothing's changed at all. 

00:29:50
NORMA Not the feelings, not the… the depth of the grief. 

00:29:55
ELS And that's what the books don't tell you. 

00:30:00
NORMA No. No. 

00:30:00
ELS Yeah. 

00:30:00
NORMA They show me strategies for getting on with it, with, you know, explanations of (inaudible ), and all that sort of stuff. And I'm sure it's rather than (inaudible ) doesn't catch it. 

00:30:15
ELS No, it's doesn't. Yeah. I feel really touched by what you said. You really got the sense of the… umm… that (inaudible ), I guess. Well, I can't really, because I am not in your position, but, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That tsunami, that rawness, that just doesn't change. 

00:30:45
NORMA And I both wanted to stop, but I don't want it to stop it well. 

00:30:50
ELS That makes sense. Yeah. 

00:30:55
NORMA Because if I lose my grief, there's an awful sense I would lose Ronnie completely. There'd be nothing left. 

00:31:05
ELS Yeah. So that's the moment the other way. Norma. 

00:31:15
[sil.] 

00:31:30
NORMA So I work and I distract myself. And… And then it catches me and there is a beautiful sunset. 

00:31:35
ELS Yeah. 

00:31:40
NORMA You can drive in to work, now in the morning, the… the sun is raising and the same beautiful colors are there. And… So I turn on the radio and John Humphries brings me back to reality and I start shouting at him, because he's so obnoxious, you know, I'm away from the moment. 

00:32:00
ELS Yeah. Yeah. Because it's not the moment you can stay in all the time and function. 

00:32:05
NORMA Yeah. 

00:32:10
ELS So there is value and almost necessity in distraction as well, as well as engaging with those moments. 

00:32:15
NORMA Yes. Yeah. 

00:32:20
[sil.] 

00:32:25
NORMA The sense of urgency I think I was saying about this. The last time that we met, that, you know, really aware this… You know, the time that I had left. Umm… We can't even going to that movie, you know, which comes to show the lost reality in it. I don't… I don't talk anything about this moment. 

00:32:55
ELS Yeah, that's right. But an awareness at life is finite. 

00:33:00
NORMA Yeah. 

00:33:00
ELS Yeah. 

00:33:05
NORMA I like watching movies. And I was looking again at the Lord of the Rings. 

00:33:10
ELS Oh, yeah. 

00:33:15
NORMA And it was just a bit of it that really stuck with me, just I don't know, maybe I was like attuned(ph) a little bit. Frodo's become to realize that he's… he's been mortally wounded, you know and he knows that and he's talking with Gandalf. And this is I wish… 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:50
NORMA …I wish the ring had never come to me. Wish none of it happened. 

00:33:55
ELS Hmm. 

00:34:00
NORMA And Gandalf, he says back to him, so do all who've been in this place. 

00:34:15
[sil.] 

00:34:20
NORMA That's not it's… you know, it's in the sense of human(ph). You can't… You can't change that. All you can do is decide to, with the time has given to you. And I don't know what time has given me, but it's a lot less though. I… I don't' want to live it. 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:34:55
NORMA With this depths of grief, I think. 

00:35:00
ELS So, that's really hard. 

00:35:00
NORMA Yeah. 

00:35:00
ELS Because that's how it is. Let the moment… 

00:35:05
NORMA I'd like to know how to do it on my own. 

00:35:10
NORMA And I think the… looking in the attic, 'cause I wouldn't have lot of people to help me. 

00:35:20
ELS Oh, (inaudible ). 

00:35:25
NORMA You know, to do it on my own. You know, good soldier, fighting on, uh… stubborn, independent. 

00:35:35
ELS And yet, just now you said, I can't do it on my own. 

00:35:40
NORMA Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely, both. And that's part of the realization, I can't do this on my own. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:15
ELS And that's, does that feel like a new realization? 

00:36:15
NORMA Yeah. Just take a little long time to come to it. I still don't like it. I can't, that idea that I can't do it on my own, that I might need somebody else. Ron was so quiet, but he was… I knew that I was never alone. 

00:36:45
ELS Ah, he was always there. 

00:36:45
NORMA He was always there. 

00:36:50
ELS Yeah, yeah. 

00:36:50
NORMA He was always there. 

00:36:50
ELS Yeah. 

00:36:50
NORMA You know. And I didn't have to explain stuff to him, he knew my cook's and he knew how different I can be, and how… you know. 

00:37:05
[sil.] 

00:37:15
NORMA He was always there. 

00:37:15
ELS Yeah. So even if you were doing things the way you wanted to do them, he was there almost like the sunset, I guess. 

00:37:25
NORMA Yeah, yeah. 

00:37:30
ELS Yeah. 

00:37:30
NORMA I could rely on that. Not aware of when and what I did. I knew there would be something that was… you know, immovable, strong, reliable… I could go home to. 

00:38:00
[sil.] 

00:38:05
NORMA And almost as quick as the sunset, he died. 

00:38:10
ELS Yeah. And that's a huge thing, a huge… a huge thing you have lost. Some of those are always there, always there. Unquestionably, for such a long time. And then suddenly, not there. And how to… how to grasp that, how to… how to be with that? 

00:38:45
[sil.] 

00:38:50
NORMA Yeah. And that's what we said last time, I can't get past out, I can't go back and open that door. And even know I can almost believe I'd… I'd… All I got to do is open my eyes and it's back as always, it's all I got to do. You know, this is… this is just a waking dream, you know. Stop (inaudible ), Norma, just turn around and… 

00:39:20
ELS Yeah, and that will be, will be back to how it was. 

00:39:20
NORMA And it would be as it was, you know. 

00:39:25
[sil.] 

00:39:30
ELS I am really struck by your saying that realize that actually, perhaps, I can't do this on my own. And I am wondering who is there for you, who might be, who might you share this with? 

00:39:50
NORMA Lots of people actually. 

00:39:50
ELS Yeah? 

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:05
NORMA Friends won't let me alone. 

00:40:10
ELS They won't let you alone? 

00:40:10
NORMA Yeah, they just keep on pestering me, you know. And at times, I just don't want to answer the phone or… but they keep on… they won't let me go. My family. 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:50
NORMA But that's again seem dependant on me as well, who doesn't want to say, you know, to burden, people, I am mindful, you know, of their feelings as well. 

00:41:00
ELS Yeah. I wonder if it's also something about allowing them to be there for you? Because you said they keep pestering me. So it doesn't sounds like they feel burdened. They… Maybe they need to do it, as well, I don't know. 

00:41:25
[sil.] 

00:41:35
NORMA Oh, relationships, you let people in and then they go, that's… that's the risk, for me, you know. 

00:41:45
ELS Yeah. True. True. So it's a risk, if you let someone in, that they go too. 

00:42:00
NORMA Yeah. Yeah. Oh, the life what headed Norma disappeared, else, I'd strive to, you know, the sensible the… the person who knew. 

00:42:20
[sil.] 

00:42:25
ELS Well. 

00:42:30
NORMA Changes everything. 

00:42:30
ELS What comes? Is this something to be sensible about? What would that mean? Yeah. 

00:42:40
NORMA I want to… may be, I'd back to, want life to be simple again. 

00:42:50
ELS Yeah. And you now know that life isn't certain. 

00:42:55
NORMA No. 

00:42:55
ELS Yeah. 

00:43:00
NORMA All I knew was this, I talk this. 

00:43:00
ELS Yeah. Of course. 

00:43:05
NORMA You and I know this. We meet every day. 

00:43:05
ELS Yeah. And see every day the books Yeah. We teach it. 

00:43:15
NORMA But it doesn't touch your experience. 

00:43:15
ELS Yeah. 

00:43:20
NORMA I like you're angry about that. What sort of how do you know about this if you ever be in this position? 

00:43:25
ELS Yeah. 

00:43:30
NORMA So I… I get angry at books as well, you know, that the authors… 

00:43:30
ELS What are they talking about. 

00:43:35
NORMA Yes. 

00:43:40
[sil.] 

00:44:00
NORMA So I know that it's about (inaudible ), but it's just really hard. 

00:44:05
ELS Yeah, you're living it and that's very different to knowing, theoretically. 

00:44:15
[sil.] 

00:44:20
NORMA What do they say, "Doctors and nurses make the worst patients." 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:30
NORMA God just make us worst. Excuse me. 

00:44:35
[sil.] 

00:44:45
ELS How are you feeling right now? What's… What's… What's happening for you right now? 

00:44:55
NORMA I thought I just noticed I am still breathing. 

00:45:00
[sil.] 

00:45:05
NORMA There's a fear of being in the tsunami that if (inaudible ), it would just overrun me. Like I won't… It would kill me, I guess. 

00:45:15
[sil.] 

00:45:20
NORMA And I have these conversations continually with myself, you know, it goes round and round, and I am my own create my own counselor. And it goes nowhere. 

00:45:30
ELS Yeah. So… 

00:45:35
NORMA But saying just a bit of it here, well… 

00:45:40
[sil.] 

00:46:20
NORMA It's probably there's a different way. 

00:46:25
[sil.] 

00:46:30
NORMA Could I tell you we're okay, is exhausting. Not stopping, it's exhausting. 

00:46:35
ELS Yeah. It is. 

00:46:40
[sil.] 

00:46:45
ELS And I was thinking of the tsunami and you're saying, I've been having these conversations on my own, you know, and it's circular. I think a tsunami, right, so, there's just always, you know, there's onslaught, but it needs to… it needs to go somewhere. 

00:47:05
NORMA Yeah. 

00:47:05
ELS But at a time may be. 

00:47:05
NORMA Yeah. 

00:47:10
ELS 'Cause all at the same time. That's a little bit… 

00:47:10
NORMA Yeah. I'm always with the wave going in. I'm never the wave coming out, the one that find land, that's… that's the feeling it. 

00:47:15
ELS Yeah, yeah. 

00:47:20
NORMA You know, I'm in that me swept away? 

00:47:20
ELS So maybe that wave… Maybe it needs little channels to… 

00:47:25
NORMA Yeah. 

00:47:25
ELS …find ways to go without drowning you. 

00:47:30
[sil.] 

00:47:35
ELS I don't know if that's helpful that analogy, but yeah. 

00:47:40
[sil.] 

00:48:00
NORMA I might be finding something in the middle that I can just hold on and anchor myself to. 

00:48:05
ELS Yeah. Can you see something in that, in that image that you just used? 

00:48:15
NORMA Yeah, I think so. 

00:48:15
ELS What? What do you… 

00:48:20
NORMA A tree that hasn't been uprooted. 

00:48:20
ELS That's right. 

00:48:20
NORMA That's got a real depth to it withstand, you know. 

00:48:25
ELS So really strong tree with deep, deep, deep roots. 

00:48:30
NORMA Yeah. 

00:48:35
[sil.] 

00:48:40
NORMA Bit like the trees and… there you are, Lord of the Rings again. 

00:48:45
ELS Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:48:50
NORMA I might drop the branches around me, I won't disappear. 

00:49:00
ELS And there's something very solid, about the tree, you know, good strength that you can hold on to. 

00:49:05
NORMA Yeah. 

00:49:10
[sil.] 

00:49:25
NORMA Feel all shivery inside. 

00:49:30
[sil.] 

00:49:40
ELS I am noticing… I am noticing myself taking deep breaths. I am noticing you're doing that too. Yeah. 

00:49:50
NORMA Yeah. 

00:49:55
[sil.] 

00:50:00
NORMA Heart is really bumping as this coming back down. 

00:50:05
ELS Can you imagine yourself in that tree and feeling supported by that strong tree? Or may be feeling it against your back and… and sitting on its strong branch and holding on? 

00:50:20
NORMA Yeah. 

00:50:25
[sil.] 

00:50:35
ELS And knowing that, that tree will stay, that's does not, hasn't been swept away. 

00:50:45
NORMA Yeah. I think that's going to be part of it. As long as I need it, I can… I can hold on to it. 

00:50:55
ELS Yeah. 

00:51:00
[sil.] 

00:51:05
NORMA I know no one can take this away, Els. 

00:51:05
ELS Yeah. 

00:51:10
[sil.] 

00:51:25
NORMA I can't have run back. 

00:51:25
ELS You can't? 

00:51:30
NORMA I can't have run back. 

00:51:30
ELS No. 

00:51:30
NORMA Perhaps, I can hold. Perhaps, if I let go of all the grief… 

00:51:40
[sil]. 

00:51:45
NORMA I might find I can still remember him. 

00:51:50
ELS Yeah. You can't have him back alive or because he is also within you, part of you. 

00:52:05
NORMA Yeah. It's a long time really, 50 years. 

00:52:15
ELS Yeah, gosh half a century. 

00:52:15
NORMA Together. It's a long time. 

00:52:20
ELS Very long time. 

00:52:25
[sil.] 

00:52:30
NORMA Yeah. 

00:52:35
[sil.] 

00:52:40
ELS And it may sound like a funny thing to say, but don't think you maybe also the role in this and the depths of your grief is also… in proportion to that enormously long time you had together, you know. And honoring… honoring that relationship. 

00:53:00
NORMA Yeah. Can't let go. Not to run away from it. Keep on running away. 

00:53:10
[sil.] 

00:53:45
NORMA I've written about this, Els, and I think about it continually, and this is one of the few times that actually opened it up. And I haven't died yet. 

00:54:05
ELS No, you haven't, you are here. 

00:54:10
[sil.] 

00:54:15
ELS So there is a tree. 

00:54:15
NORMA What is it? 

00:54:15
ELS There is a tree in some way. 

00:54:20
NORMA Yeah. 

00:54:25
[sil.] 

00:54:35
NORMA So perhaps I can do it elsewhere. 

00:54:40
[sil.] 

00:54:45
NORMA Because the other is not working. 

00:54:45
ELS Sorry? 

00:54:45
NORMA The other way is not working. 

00:54:50
ELS Yeah. 

00:54:55
[sil.] 

00:55:00
NORMA Oh, excuse me. 

00:55:05
[sil.] 

00:55:10
ELS Yes, so perhaps it's possible to do it elsewhere in that… Yeah. Let someone else in or allow yourself and also have to do it all on your own. 

00:55:20
NORMA Yeah. 

00:55:25
[sil.] 

00:55:40
ELS Is this a good time to leaving? Okay. Thanks, Norma. 

00:55:45
NORMA Thank you. 

00:55:45
ELS Okay. 

00:55:45
NORMA Yeah.

[sil.] 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN Okay, Els, you've just had a session with Norma. How was that for you? 

00:56:10
ELS Yeah, it was interesting because this was the second session. So I actually felt umm… that yeah, I was listening obviously to you talking with Norma just now, and (inaudible ) too, it felt much more of a relationship. And… But I noticed that Norma appeared more nervous than last time, whereas I felt fine, less nervous. 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN Well. 

00:56:35
ELS Yeah. 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN So I guess there's the different balance between the technicalities of making a video, and the realities of actually a therapy. 

00:56:45
ELS Yeah, yeah. And of course I had no idea what Norma would want to talk about today. But I was hoping that we would continue from what we talked about last time. 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN You were hoping. So there wouldn't be an expectation you would direct them. 

00:57:00
ELS No, no, of course not. 

00:57:05
UNKNOWN Would you have considered bringing up what she said last time? 

00:57:10
ELS Only if it felt appropriate. 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN So when you make… Because you did make the link, and that was the point at which was she was saying, was linking to what she was saying… 

00:57:20
ELS Yes, of course, but if it was very clear from the beginning that Norma really didn't want to talk about it and wanted to talk about something entirely different, then I would have gone with that, unless somewhere it felt appropriate. But, yeah. Yeah. 

00:57:35
UNKNOWN Okay. There was a sense of how brushing against something quite early on, and when she said, I didn't want to… I don't want to talk about that. What was happening for you then, it was almost like a door open and then she slammed it shut for a little while? 

00:57:50
ELS Yeah. Well, I… I thought, okay, but she's mentioned it, so I'd sort of held that ambivalence if you like. And I thought maybe she will. We'll see how it goes. 

00:58:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:58:00
ELS Yeah, I would… I would never push someone where they don't want to go. 

00:58:10
UNKNOWN So you were following her? 

00:58:10
ELS Yeah, because pushing someone where they are not ready to go is not a good idea. 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

00:58:15
ELS Yeah. And I know Norma well enough to know that. You know, she's very aware of her own process. So, yeah. 

00:58:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. There were couple of times when you offered her no more than the idea, but of hesitate to even say strategies, but a bit of a sense of the outside world. Uh… There are other people that… that she's not an island that there may be alternatives. 

00:58:50
ELS Yeah, yeah. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN What was that… that… that thought really helpful to? 

00:58:55
ELS Yeah. Well, it's interesting because she used that image of a tsunami. And I'm… I'm fairly, I'm very visual anyway, so I… I saw that tsunami and then literally my brain sort of going round and round and round. You know, that's not gonna go anywhere. That really needs other people. That needs something else. 

00:59:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:59:15
ELS But it was really inform to (inaudible ) to what Norma said, because she had, at some points said. "I can't do it alone". And then went back to, "I need to do this on my own". So I brought her back to, this is what you said. 

00:59:30
UNKNOWN Yes, yes, yes. And I thought really important… 

00:59:35
ELS And that also felt a movement on from the first session, where that wasn't happening. 

00:59:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. The image of the tree felt very important and very nice too, very solid rooted into the ground. 

00:59:50
ELS Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that again, came out of tsunami because of, Norma said, "I need to hold on to something", so I said "Okay, what might be that?" Because I didn't want to offer something because it might well be the right thing, So, Norma said the tree. So that felt very good. I thought, oh, good, a solid tree, it's very different to a raft. 

01:00:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:00:10
ELS Yeah. 

01:00:10
UNKNOWN Yes. It's going to stay put. 

01:00:15
ELS It's going to stay put. It survived the tsunami, it's strong enough. That felt very good. 

01:00:20
UNKNOWN What other thoughts do you have about session? 

01:00:25
ELS Yeah, it was… it was very moving. But I felt… I felt completely… completely with her in… in… yeah, like she said that sunset, and I could really see that and feel that. And yeah, throughout really I… I felt really with her. 

01:00:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you very much. 

01:00:45
ELS Thank you.

01:01:00
UNKNOWN Okay, Norma, so you've just had a session with Els. What was that like? 

01:01:05
NORMA Difficult. 

01:01:10
UNKNOWN Difficult. 

01:01:10
NORMA But… not as difficult as I began to think it was right at the beginning, it would be umm… I wasn't too sure what I was going to talk about. Umm… But there was a sense that I could use this opportunity to open something I knew I'd been avoiding for quite a long while. 

01:01:45
UNKNOWN Right. And I was watching your session. And it felt as if you are not quite sure whether you were going to go now or not. But you are almost testing out, maybe I will, maybe I won't. 

01:02:00
NORMA Yeah. 

01:02:00
UNKNOWN And I wonder whether there was anything particular about what Els was doing, how she was working, that made you decide you're going to. 

01:02:10
NORMA I think she really tuned in to that ambivalence that I was feeling, didn't rush me. I didn't have, in a sense of her saying, "I know where you want to go. Come on." She really stayed alongside me. And I began to feel safe enough and even when I was dipping in to some really painful feelings, I've still felt safe. I was sort of trembling, but I didn't feel as if I was out of my depth, you know, I was talking with the tsunami but… I knew that I wasn't going to drown there, I used the metaphor of the… of the tree. And I think for those, you know, about short wave, I had the tree and I was hanging on to it. 

01:03:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:03:20
NORMA And yes, it was a presence and her… calm, that… that was the strength. 

01:03:35
UNKNOWN That helped to make the tree in. 

01:03:35
NORMA Yeah. The voice, the voice is also so calm and so soft, and it wasn't… she wasn't interfering with what I was needed to do, whether it was, you know, in and out the stuff or… and there was a told me about a philosophy, a philosopher that she'd read, and it really caught my meaning. 

01:04:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:04:05
NORMA And I thought, yeah, she's… she's with me, she knows what I'm saying, she understands it, you know. 

01:04:10
UNKNOWN So she understood what you're saying, showed she was understanding what you were saying, but also with beside you, not ahead of you, not pulling you into the water. 

01:04:25
NORMA Yeah. 

01:04:25
UNKNOWN Not pulling you deep into the water. 

01:04:25
NORMA Yeah. There is no sense of that. 

01:04:30
UNKNOWN There was a moment quite early on, where you said something, I think you said, I don't want to go there. Something had come into your head, and then you said, I don't want to look at that. And there was no sense I could see from her, sort of, grabbing your arm and sort of saying that you must do it. 

01:04:55
NORMA No. I needed to feel safe unless, I wasn't sure at the beginning where I would to say what the heart say. I needed to feel very safe and that's what… that's what she provided for me, with a safe place I were. 

01:05:10
UNKNOWN You know, this was an unusual situation for all of us because this is the second session 

01:05:15
NORMA Yeah. Yeah. 

01:05:15
UNKNOWN For technical reasons. The first session we did… 

01:05:15
NORMA Yeah. 

01:05:20
UNKNOWN …we couldn't use. So you came back. 

01:05:20
NORMA Yeah. Yeah. 

01:05:20
UNKNOWN So there was a bit more, and of course you know Els anyway, she's a colleague, but there was a bit more of a relationship. And I wonder how that effected what was going on. 

01:05:35
NORMA Yeah. Yeah, I think you're right. But that haven't occurred to me actually because I was quite nervous at the beginning. I More nervous than I was at the first one. 

01:05:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:05:45
NORMA You know. And… Knowing that she'd remembered what we talked about at the first time was also important. 

01:05:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:06:00
NORMA Added to the sense of safety that I had you know, she's cared enough to remember. 

01:06:05
UNKNOWN Right, she cared enough. 

01:06:10
NORMA Yeah. Yeah. And it was helping me what we talked about that first one too, to develop what I needed, how to go deeper into what I needed to say. 

01:06:25
[sil.] 

01:06:35
NORMA I thought really held like in that. 

01:06:36
UNKNOWN Or being held and not being pulled allow you to do the work you wanted to do. Was there anything else about how she was that you can remember? 

01:06:50
NORMA I love the way that she worked with my metaphors and was in fact easy about that. And it wasn't, you know, she worked with the images that I had and really got the bit about the… the sunset and the tsunami, you know. Els didn't introduce that, she worked with my, and she really helped me to develop my understanding of what I was trying to grasp, which is working with my images, if you like and I really appreciated that. Umm… That helped me to deepen not just my understanding, but my feelings as well and to stay with them. 

01:07:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:07:45
[sil.] 

01:07:50
NORMA And… other thing… For the first time in a long time, I moved from my head into my… into my heart, you feel like into… However experience this grief not how I thought about it and avoided it. 

01:08:10
UNKNOWN Right. Anything else? 

01:08:15
[sil.] 

01:08:20
NORMA No, just that. There's a possibility that I've got, there might be a different way. 

01:08:25
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you for doing this. 

01:08:25
NORMA Thank you. 

01:08:30

01:08:35
[sil.] 

01:08:40
UNKNOWN Okay, Els, you describe yourself as an integrative therapist? 

01:08:45
ELS Yes, I describe myself as a relational integrative therapist. I think. Yeah. 

01:08:50
UNKNOWN Okay. What does that mean? 

01:08:55
ELS So it's a relationship, it's very much at the center of… of… of that particular approach. And my… The integration is a combination of humanistic, and psychodynamic, and CBT, but the contemporary versions of all three. So mindfulness, compassion based, CBT, relational stroke, inter-subjective psychodynamic therapy, which is very different from the classical Freudian approach. And the contemporary humanistic approach, particularly (inaudible ) and working at relational depths type of person-centered therapy. 

01:09:35
UNKNOWN So there is a whole range of things informing you. 

01:09:35
ELS It's a integration. If you… If you imagine a Venn… a Venn diagram, yeah, with the three approaches and then there where they overlap in the center, that's… that's I see as the approach. 

01:09:50
UNKNOWN In the middle there? 

01:09:50
ELS In the middle. Yeah. 

01:09:50
UNKNOWN And would you see one of them as being more dominant than the others? 

01:09:55
ELS It depends, it… it really depends because it's very, it can be flexible. So with some clients, I may end up working in a more mindfulness based way, with other clients, I may be more person-centered if you like or dialogic, but I think it… it moves around, it moves around. 

01:10:15
UNKNOWN So you're responding to the needs of the clients in that moment. 

01:10:20
ELS Yes, yes, but saying that I'm always aware of the here and now and also of the past and previous, the client's past, but also past sessions we've had and of course where we might… where we might go in the future. 

01:10:35
UNKNOWN So how did all that inform, how you're working with Norma? 

01:10:40
ELS Yeah, that's interesting because and as I said earlier, it felt because this was the second… a second session that it was more of a relationship already, so that felt very, very important. And from the mental really to… to this way of working is because the relationship is so important, I need to be very attuned, both to Norma and to myself how I feel, how, you know, to feel completely authentically me, so that I can be completely in relationship. 

01:11:15
UNKNOWN I'm just conscious of how much you stressed the importance of relationship. I said you were an integrative therapist. 

01:11:20
ELS Yes. 

01:11:20
UNKNOWN You said, I'm relational. I now feels like that's a real kind of foundation stone for how you work. 

01:11:25
ELS It is. It is. Yeah. And… And in fact that's the foundation stone in those three contemporary versions of the three main approaches that's actually… 

01:11:35
UNKNOWN So none of them will deny the importance of that. 

01:11:40
ELS No. 

01:11:40
UNKNOWN Well, as if you look back, certainly psychoanalytic, it feels very distant from… 

01:11:45
ELS Yeah, the difference is that in the past even something like person-centered therapy, they were on one person therapy what they call one person therapies. In that you had the client and you had the therapist or a counselor, but all the focus was on the client, yeah. Whereas now, it's much more what's happening between us. We create something between us, we create meaning out of what's the client presents between us. 

01:12:15
UNKNOWN Right. When you said that what came into my head was a famous moment in the Gloria tapes with Carl Rogers where he says, I think you would have made a pretty nice daughter. 

01:12:20
ELS Exactly. 

01:12:25
UNKNOWN I remember that being discussed a great deal uh… both at the time and later. 

01:12:30
ELS Yeah. 

01:12:30
UNKNOWN But in a sense, that was an acknowledgment of a relationship between you two of them, yeah. 

01:12:35
ELS Something was happening. Yes. Yes. 

01:12:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. How did you… How did you come to this integration because my guess is you weren't immediately taught here is an integration. 

01:12:50
ELS No. My original counseling diploma, I think was largely person-centered with based on Eagen(ph) etcetera. And I found… And it was basically focusing on short-term therapy, but after a few years of working, I realized that I needed more training because once you can deeply listen to someone, you'll fairly quickly get into something deep and I thought I haven't got the training for that, so that's when I did further psychotherapy training. And this psychotherapy training was integrative. It was a combination of psychodynamic and humanistic, yeah. But they had already done a course in mindfulness based therapy as well before that, yeah. 

01:13:30
UNKNOWN Right. So all of those things are in (inaudible ). 

01:13:35
ELS All went into the pot, yeah, yeah. 

01:13:35
UNKNOWN What's there been about psychoanalytic that's important to you psychodynamic… 

01:13:40
ELS Oh, I think that, there is definitely a lot more going on under the surface than we are consciously aware of, so for me, it's not just about what's in my mind now, but what's under the surface for the client as well as… as well as for me because it's impossible to be aware of everything at the same time. So that's very important for me. That almost there is a process that grows on unconsciously and nonverbally, even as we're sitting, talking together and certainly with the client that they don't necessarily know what it is, but we know something is happening. 

01:14:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:14:20
ELS So where the dreams a lot for example. 

01:14:20
UNKNOWN Right, so it's not just happening, it's also impacting, it's… it's not, those unconscious things aren't just running along without actually affecting us. 

01:14:30
ELS Yeah, absolutely. You know, sometimes I… I open the door to a client and I look at them and I have a sense of how they're going to be, you know, what's… what's going on for them. You know, to say I knew something was going to happen during the week and they think, uh, okay. It didn't go well. Oh, what happened? Completely unconscious really are. 

01:14:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:14:55
ELS Certainly nonverbal. 

01:14:55
UNKNOWN But you just picked, yes, nonverbal. Yeah. 

01:14:55
ELS Yeah. 

01:15:00
UNKNOWN I'm also aware we… we touched on this briefly when we were just talking after the session with Norma, but something about and I think this will give the CBT element to the integrational part of that. You were talking about out there what she could do out there that there was a world beyond the therapy room. She might take what happens here out there. 

01:15:30
ELS I guess so, yes. I guess so. I'm not sure that other therapies wouldn't do that as well, but certainly is CBT, we'll do that. But for me, the CBT is very much a mindfulness-based CBT and I see the way I am in the session normally before I see clients, I like to have some space almost like a few minutes of mindfulness, so that while I'm in the session, I… I aim to be in that very attentive space, so that I can be really present. 

01:16:00
UNKNOWN Listening to your client, being with your client and yourself. 

01:16:00
ELS And myself to… to notice what I feel in response to the client, so I'll notice how I'm breathing for example or I may notice something suddenly popping into my head and then thinking like that, for instance that quote from a philosopher came into my head just like that and they think, uh, that's interesting. Is this going to be useful? Okay, I think it might, I'll offer it, you know. 

01:16:25
UNKNOWN And I guess the offering is a tricky one or needs to be managed carefully because if it's not right, it's quite a diversion. 

01:16:35
ELS Yeah. And if it's not right, then I will ask. So, I didn't get that right for you. How was that? What was going on? Yeah. 

01:16:45
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. Because it's… it's like I said something like that is either right in which cases enhancing helping movement or is it like a road block, because you got it wrong I guess. 

01:16:55
ELS Yeah, and that would be a rupture. 

01:16:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:16:55
ELS So that will be an example of a rapture, but at the same time I also believe that actually ruptures are important because we can't… life doesn't always get it right. In no relationship does… do we always get it right, so rupture, as long as you repair it and it's… that's part of the psychodynamic way of thinking about that experience of having, of being able to survive a rupture and repair it actually connect a relationship stronger and also help the clients to translate that to the world out there in other relationships. 

01:17:30
UNKNOWN So, not the perfect therapist who always gets it right. 

01:17:35
ELS That's because you're annoying. Probably. 

01:17:40
UNKNOWN Who sometimes gets it wrong and then we work at understanding role, both how is that wrong and how did it feel getting it wrong? 

01:17:50
ELS Yeah, yeah, yes. What was that like for you? 

01:17:50
UNKNOWN I do. Yeah. 

01:17:50
ELS Yeah. Yeah. And it does happen sometimes. But sometimes, yeah. Sometimes the client comes in the next week and say somebody is really upset something you said, and I say, "What did I say?" And said well, "You said X." And either I said or I didn't, but it was heard that way so, okay, what was that idea that made you hear it that way, you know, but it's useful because usually something gets strengthen because of that. It's really important to go into it and not be defensive but curious, curiosity I guess is the… is the answer. What's happened there? 

01:18:25
UNKNOWN Yes. Because he is always learning from any interchange, any experience. 

01:18:30
ELS Yeah. Yeah, absolutely because we all look at any… any situations through… through our own window, don't we? 

01:18:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:18:35
ELS And no two windows are the same. 

01:18:40
UNKNOWN But in the sense, one thing is got a bit wrong, we might get a sense of each other's window. 

01:18:45
ELS Yeah. 

01:18:45
UNKNOWN How are you looking at this and how am I looking at this. 

01:18:45
ELS Yes, and it may quite different. 

01:18:50
UNKNOWN I guess any relationship there's an awareness of simple things like turn the voice about missing what's been said and set forth. 

01:18:55
ELS Oh absolutely. 

01:18:55
UNKNOWN And in the therapy room, is the opportunity to actually look at those things and learn from them. 

01:19:05
ELS And I think that's really important, that's an important part of therapy, yeah. 

01:19:10
UNKNOWN The… The transferring outside and inside. 

01:19:10
ELS Yeah. Yes. So necessary failure is the term that sometimes used that it's almost necessary sometimes to… to fail a bit in order to find that what's really going on and… and to help it repair and to have the… for the client to have the experience of the other person say, I'm really sorry, I didn't get that right, what happened etcetera. 

01:19:30
UNKNOWN I guess there's a parallel here with the good enough parent. 

01:19:30
ELS Absolutely, yeah. 

01:19:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, a good enough parent fails their child because it's important to learn from that. 

01:19:40
ELS Yeah. Otherwise that child won't be prepared for the real world. 

01:19:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. You referred to mindfulness several times, I'm conscious that it's something I feel that it's become part of therapy in recent years. 

01:19:45
ELS Yes. 

01:19:50
UNKNOWN Can you say a bit more about that? 

01:19:55
ELS Well, it's clearly not a new thing. It's clearly, it's a form of meditation and it's been around for thousands of years, but it's very interesting that in… in the last 10 years or so, it's really caught on in the… in the west, I think starting with (inaudible ) who is an Buddhist anyway. And that so many people find it useful. Maybe because we are living in such a busy time and everybody has to be doing, doing, doing something all the time and it's just too much, so to learn how to be quite and yeah, how to take… take time in the… in the moment if you like, not to feel so driven all the time. And… And another thing I wanted to mention about mindfulness and how mindfulness based CBT is different from traditional first or second wave of CBT is that it doesn't… When people have negative thoughts for example, it's not to argue against him or try and replace them with positive thoughts, but to become aware of them, just to notice them and let them… let them be there and let them go and say and become interest, oh, that's interesting, else seems to thinking not again. So to create a… create a distance between the thinking and… and the person. Does it make sense? 

01:21:20
UNKNOWN Alright. Yes. Yes. But I do think there's something about being curious which you referred to earlier. 

01:21:25
ELS Yes. For the client to… to become curious. 

01:21:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. Why… Why do I do this? What's this about? I notice this. 

01:21:30
ELS Yes, yeah. 

01:21:30
UNKNOWN And it's something about not taking simply our face value, this is how I am, but rather recognizing me as a more fluid person that can learn from experience and notice what happened and almost decide, well, is that how I wanted to be? Is that how I want me to be? 

01:21:50
ELS And that's exactly what Norma was doing, that's how she started. 

01:21:55
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

01:21:55
ELS First she started with a very way of… 

01:21:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:22:00
ELS …I've notice, I'm noticing this about myself. Yeah. 

01:22:05
UNKNOWN What else do you bring to therapy? 

01:22:10
ELS What else do I bring to therapy? Well, I certainly bring myself. I am a real person. I aim to be completely present and tuned into everything that goes on, but of course what else I bring is… is a lot of experience and as Donna Orange calls it, my internal chorus of theories, past supervisors, current supervisors, colleagues, all sort of helpful things past clients I worked with, all that goes into pot, so that when I'm with someone, things just pop into my mind to where I'm reminded of stuff and then of course it's decision whether to say this or whether to not say it to what it say, yeah, that might well be the cakes but not now, you know so there is quite a lot of going on inside as I sit there with the client and even when they say nothing, but there's a lot going on inside. 

01:23:10
UNKNOWN Always a decision whether to speak or not to speak to off far and not off far. 

01:23:15
ELS Yeah. And if the client is clearly thinking, you know, then I like that I think there were one or two silences where I felt it's really important not to interrupt. Yeah, till another occasion, if the client keeps talking and I think it's defense, then I may well interrupt I say, "Can I just interrupt you because there is something important I want to say or to observe or…" Yeah. 

01:23:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. And I guess we're all aware of that client that talks and talks and talks and it's a way of avoiding rather than actually way of… 

01:23:45
ELS Absolutely. And they don't actuate it. Now, if that happens on the first session, maybe second session, maybe they just need to do that before they can let go, but if every session is like that, nothing happens. 

01:23:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:24:00
ELS So that's something that needs to be brought to their attention. 

01:24:00
UNKNOWN I've been coming to you now for 20 weeks and nothing has changed. 

01:24:05
ELS And nothing is happening. Yeah, that's why. You are not letting me in, of course you don't do it like that. 

01:24:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. What else would you say was important to you when you are working with the clients, particularly with the new client? 

01:24:20
ELS I think it's important that they feel welcomed and that they feel at ease and that's they… I… I think I try to make things equal, so not that they think, oh, I'm coming to see, you know the therapist who is the authority and the expert and they tell me what to do. So, I think it's important also that's how I explain a bit about umm… what therapy or counseling is if they don't know, so I explain that it's not about them coming to tell me their issues and I'm going to say, but I think it's going on what they should be doing about it, that's it's collaborative, that we figure it out between us. And also that it's important for them to tell me when it's not helpful, you know, when they get it wrong to actually to just say, to just say. 

01:25:15
UNKNOWN Getting it wrong is information(ph). 

01:25:15
ELS Yeah. Exactly. 

01:25:20
UNKNOWN Tells us a lot about what's happening. Yeah. 

01:25:20
ELS Yeah and but especially with a new client, I… I want to know what they… what they think, what… what they want to happen. What sort of particularly if it's going to be short-term work because sometimes clients know that they only want a couple of brief periods. I say, okay, well, (inaudible ) you will be done, a three months, six months whatever and at the end of it you… you have completely gained what you needed, you know what would it be. And I say, Oh, yeah, and it helps them to focus what their role is as well. 

01:25:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:25:55
ELS What do they want? It's not just sitting there and receiving therapy. They… I guess I try to make it clear that it's active, it's a… it's a collaboration between the two of us. 

01:26:10
UNKNOWN The image that came into my mind was what is not like is your car breaks down and you phone up a mechanic to come and do it and then you sit in the car while he fixes it and then you drive off. it's much more about you both get out, look under the bonnet and start trying to figure out when I do this, that happens, when I do that, this happens. 

01:26:30
ELS And what about that. 

01:26:35
UNKNOWN Yes. What's… What's… I notice this that kind of working together to come to a conclusion and then you know what you want to do. 

01:26:45
ELS Yes. So for me and of course all the research says that the most important thing really regarding what happens to therapy are client factors, the client has to be in the… in the place where they can make use of… of… of therapy and counseling. And the second most important factor is the relationship and only after that, maybe what you actually do in the session… 

01:27:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:27:05
ELS …you know the actual techniques that you might be using. So I… I guess I… I never have a plan of okay, this is a person who is depressed, therefore I'm going to do X, Y and Z. It's nothing like that, it always has to come out of the relationship and what we create between us. 

01:27:25
UNKNOWN So not about techniques. 

01:27:30
ELS I may well use techniques. 

01:27:30
UNKNOWN But it's not what the therapy is about.
