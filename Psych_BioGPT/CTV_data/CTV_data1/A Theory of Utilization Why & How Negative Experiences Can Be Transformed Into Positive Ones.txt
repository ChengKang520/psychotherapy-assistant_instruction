A Theory of Utilization: Why & How Negative Experiences Can Be Transformed into Positive Ones 

00:00:00
Stephen Gilligan, Ph.D

STEPHEN GILLIGAN, PH.D Hi, everybody. Nice to see you all. And, uh, thank you for that wonderful introduction. Um, I don't know if the word "tireless" would be, uh, an apt word for right now, but, uh, i-, it really has been, uh, really, the joy of my life to be exposed to Milton Erickson's work, and to, um, be able to, um, explore it in so many different ways. It's, um, what you might call, "the gift that keeps on giving," um, so to speak. Um, I think, th-, there's so many differences. I, I, I remember Jeff once saying that, um, there are many, many, many good therapists, uh, but one of the things that distinguished Dr. Erickson was, uh, how many really good students he had. And, uh, I'm, I, I'm serious. I, I'm not really talking about myself, but, but the incredible, he, he has that, uh, that flow chart, uh, on the, um, the congress, uh, syllabus, and you see that he inspired so many different people, uh, top-level people that took the work in, in so many different directions. And so th-, the differences are, are, uh, in some ways more impressive than the similarities. But if there is one similarity, there's one shared sense that, uh, every one of his students would have, I, I'm pretty sure it's on this idea of utilization. You know, I say that when the dust settles, and, and to some extent it has settled, um, because it's been, what, 31 years since Dr. Erickson died. Uh, I think that what we really see as the enduring contribution that Milton Erickson made of many, many extraordinary contributions, was this very ex-, extraordinary, uh, radical idea of, of utilization that you can open to. You can open your whole being - your heart, your head, your mind, your soul - to everything that's there, and give it a place, give it a home in a particular way, so it can be able to transform into a resource, um, in a person's life. It's, it's a little bit strange to me that because it's such a generative thing, and such a, a shared agreement, that there's been, in my view, relatively little work done on talking about, "How do you actually practice this?" I mean, in many ways we're often just left with these extraordinarily creative, uh, dazzling, humorous stories of Erickson's cases. But in terms of, "How did he do that?" I think that we need, uh, we've got a long ways to go, in terms of talking about it in a way that therapists can, uh, we as therapists can learn to do it better. And, uh, one of the things I'm gonna suggest, that it's something that we really want to teach our clients to be able to do too. That one of the things that we can really help our clients is teaching them how to be open to everything that life gives you. And that's a skill, it's not just a, a sort of, a w-, a warm California-fuzzy sort of thing. You know, but it's a really, it's a lifetime skill that we have to devote ourselves to doing. So, in this short hour, um, I'd like to share with you just a, a few ideas, uh, in terms of how we might think about this a little bit more clearly, uh, hopefully to give rise to better practices of training ourselves, training students, and helping our clients to be able to do it. Those of you that know me know that, uh, always like to begin with a poem, partly to honor my Irish roots, and, um, partly to really emphasize therapy is first and foremost a poetic language. Trance is basically a poetic rather than a literal language. So what we're looking to do is use language to get beyond language in the therapeutic setting. Um, people are caught, in a sense, within the verbal box. They're caught within these rigid concepts. And what trance is, is really helping us to do is open the space beyond the rigid concepts, because that's a poetic language. So if I say to you, "You really can relax," and you say, "Yeah, I read that book too," that's not trance. But if I say to you, "You really can relax," and you take a nice yawn, that's a trance, now it's working, because we've got that mind-body connection that's going. So I want to share with you a brief poem by, uh, the great Sufi poet from, uh, the, uh Thirteenth century, Rumi. Uh, some people say that he's the greatest poet that ever lived, and I don't argue with them. Uh, these are co-, this is on a, Coleman Barks is the great American translator of Rumi, is called, "A Goat Kneels." And, uh, every time I, uh, read this poem I think of Erickson, in terms of what he was able to do, and, and, what a great model for us as therapists in terms, uh, that we can do that too. So here's what Rumi says. He says, "The inner being of a human being is a jungle. Sometimes wolves dominate, and sometimes wild hogs. Be careful when you breathe. At every moment a new species arises in the chest, now a demon, now an angel, and now a wild animal. But there are also those in this amazing jungle who can absorb you into their own surrender. So, if you have to stalk and steal something, steal from them. There are also those in this amazing jungle who can absorb you into their own surrender, so if you have to stalk and steal something, steal from them." So one of the points I'm gonna be really emphasizing is that utilization is not merely an intellectual trick. It's not something that you can just do from your head. One of the most impressive things that I got, as this 19-year-old with Erickson, was that how fully present he was at so many, many different levels, and so this notion of utilization was not saying, "Well, they're doing that. Maybe I can trick 'em into doing this," but it was being willing and able to absorb whatever, everything that the client was bringing, and to hold it in a particular way, so that a lot of new possibilities came up. OK? So, that's what I'd like to talk about with you. So, um, this notion of utilization, uh, of course, we can just simply define as this creative acceptance/use of any pattern - whether it's behavioral, cognitive, emotional - as the primary basis for the goal achievement. That could be a trance, that could be a therapy outcome, whatever shows up: that's that ticket, so to speak. Now there's so many extraordinary examples that one I just want to, uh, bring up, I know, uh, probably most of you are familiar with this one: the woman with the gap in her teeth. And I bring it up because it's a really good teaching example. And there are different versions, but th-, give you a shorthand version of this woman who worked as a secretary, um, in a, uh, uh, an office, and, um, she was, uh, sh-, she came into Erickson. She was suicidal. And Erickson said, "So, why are you suicidal?" She said, "Well, isn't it obvious?" And she opens her mouth to display that there's a large gap between her front teeth. And to her this meant she was so ugly, and so undesirable as a woman, which to this 1950s secretary meant, "I have no reason to live if I can't have a husband." So Erickson didn't say, "No, you're really not that bad. You're really kind of pretty if you just look at it different." He said, "Well, before you kill yourself, I'd like you to make a few commitments. I'd like to do a few things," and, and he got her agreement. And the first thing he had her do, much to her horror, was to go home every night and practice filling her mouth with water and learning how to squirt the water through her teeth, until she got skillful at hitting a target at some distance. She was, of course, as many of these things, dumbfounded. But Erickson reminded her a, a, a commitment is a commitment. So for a couple weeks she did this until she got good at hitting a target at a reasonable distance. He found out then that, that, that might have been a little mutual attraction with a s-, uh, a young single guy at the office. She was totally sure that he couldn't possibly be interested in her, but it just so happened that they were showing up at the water cooler around the same time, uh, every day. So once she got skillful at squirting the water he said, "I want you to notice when this guy, when this fellow goes up to get a drink, and I want you to run up, fill your mouth with water, hide behind the wall, and when he leans down I want you to r-, to jump out, give him a good squirt, and then run like the devil." And again, she's shocked, but it, an agreement is an agreement. So this happens. He goes to take the drink. She squirts him, uh, uh, he runs after her, asks her for a date. And as, as most of these Erickson stories, uh, gets married shortly thereafter, and immediately has six little water-squirters. So that case, i-, it's funny, as most of these cases, it's amazing. Th-, they're beautiful, they're serious cases, th-, they're really working with these really core things. But he had such a, a wonderful humor. So how do we understand that? Practically speaking, how the heck to you get from, uh, "This means I'm so ugly I have to kill myself," to, "This means I can squirt water and nail this guy and so he runs after me?" OK? What is that leap that occurs? If we try to do it simply intellectually, I think most of us will fail. So I'd like to just give you a little sense of what I think may be going on. So in this, sort of, this theory of utilization, we always start with the sense that reality is not fixed, reality does not exist independently of an observer, reality is constructed. So what you experience of, of who you are, what you experience as the world around you, that's something that's constructed. Doesn't mean that it's just individually constructed there, as we talk about these filters of, uh, biological levels, and they have cultural levels, they have, uh, familial levels, but you've got these filters through which the world is being constructed. And so, what we're interested in is, is, "How is it constructed?" And all the different theories of hypnosis posit that there's two different minds, different versions of these two minds. But the two minds, of course, are the unconscious mind and the conscious mind. There are many, many different theories of the unconscious mind, and there should be, right? The one I'd like to, uh, suggest today is what, m-ut, in some ways might be called a, "meta-theory," which is that the, the unconscious, is a quantum field. OK, uh, and by "quantum field" I mean it's this space, it's a virtual space, it's not, a m-, immaterial reality. It has multiple co-existing realities simultaneously present. OK, in quantum, quantum physics there's something called a superposition. Superposition is a mathematical wave equation that carries all possible forms, uh, all possible states of something simultaneously. So how is that practical? What that means is that in the unconscious, is that there is an infinite number of possible forms for every particular pattern. So take an individual. Take Steve Consciousness here. I might come to you and say, "My name is Steve and I'm depressed." OK? That's my presentation. If you buy into that hypnosis, you probably won't be able to help me. OK? From the quantum view, there's an infinite number of possible Steves. How many can you see right now? How many of you can see a three-year-old Steve up here? Not that hard, is it? How many of you can see an old man Steve? I'm gettin' there. OK? So, inside, you say, in the unconscious, there's an infinite number of possible selves, or infinite number of possible forms for any particular pattern. OK? Now again, I, say that this super-positional field idea applies at micro-levels. It applies at, for example, at the gap in the teeth. The gap in the teeth could mean in infinite number of possible things. OK? And that's what we're looking to get to. We're looking to get ourselves there, and then to help a client become un-rigid and more creative. We're looking to get them back into the field of infinite possibilities. But also we see that there's an infinite number of unconscious minds. Uh, Freud looked into the unconscious. What did he see? Sex, drugs, rock and roll. Right? Jung looked in and he saw a pantheon of archetypal saints. Erickson looked in and he saw a vast repository, a, a vast storehouse of experiential learnings. The Buddhists look in to what they call "original mind" and they see nothing. It's empty, but luminescent. So from the quantum view they're all valid. OK? That doesn't mean that in every community that they would fit for that community, because that community is practicing other things as well. But in principle, there's in infinite number of possible representations for every particular pattern. OK? That's where all the creative stuff happens. That's why we do trance. OK? So, have a art therapist student, Abby Miller, and she's kindly helping out with these, psychedelic, uh, sorts of presentations. So w-, we have this sense that a particular pattern, and again, if we say a pattern, the gap in the teeth, we say that in the unconscious, is that there are multiple, many, uh, a shimmering sea of multiple representations, multiple meanings, multiple ways that it can play out, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. OK. Now, we say that one of the things about the unconscious is that it is eternal and timeless. What you see in trance, that happens a lot, that people's sense of time disappears. Or you can have multiple times simultaneously present. But eternity and the timeless is not all that it's cracked up to be. Because in eternity nothing ever happens. This, you know, like we say in California, "It's another day in paradise." Uh, so, in the eternal world of infinite possibilities nothing ever gets created. That's where the conscious world comes in. So in the quantum, uh, metaphor there's a, we say that, that the int-, the, the quantum, the unconscious world of infinite possibilities is collapsed into a single actuality. So, infinite possibility goes into the conscious world into one specific actuality. OK? And that we need that in, in order to exist in the world. So if you say, "Well, who are you?" Well, I can just be anybody you want, or I guess I'm everything. OK? That's not gonna make it, right? So we need the capacity also to say, "This is who I am. Of all the possibilities, this is my truth. This is my experience right now. I've got to take a particular position here." OK? And as I do that I actually exist, "exstande," to stand out in the world. OK? And That allows me to begin to move in time, create, experience, change, transform, and to be able to have, have this whole experience of human life. So that conscious world we say that moves from meta-, pattern. OK? That, that spoked out in all those, in that wheel of infinite possibilities. Now we see that in the conscious world, a pattern means a specific thing. OK? Pattern means a specific thing. So that gap in the teeth. OK? Means, means, I decide that it means that I'm so ugly I have to kill myself. Now a question is, "How does a specific form get generated? Out of all the infinite possibilities, how does that specific one occur?" And we say, "These are what are called the 'state filters'," if you will. OK. That depending on how you are adjusting your filters, OK, then the unconscious collapses into one specific wave. Uh, when, uh, I did, uh, my graduate research at, at Stanford, over five-and-a-half years, it was, we did about 30 experiments on the topic of, of state-dependent learning and memory. And they used hypnosis to train people to enter into emotional mood states - happiness, sadness, or anger - and then looked at when they were in that particular mood state, how did it influence, if at all, various cognitive processes? Well we found, as they found in a number of these different so-called state- dependent patters, that when you're in a particular state, you're biased in the direction of that state. All you can think, all you can feel, is what's inside that particular state. So when people were in a sad state they remembered a preponderance of, of sad memories, autobiographically. They made pessimistic predictions about the future. If you gave them characters to identify with in a story, is, that they would connect with, th-, the sad characters. So the state that you're in biases you to create your experience in a way that is consistent with that state. OK? Now as I say, the, the filters are many, many, many different levels. OK? So they're cultural filters, they're family filters, there's your personal history filters, and so forth, and so on. OK? When these filters get locked in, we call that a "state." OK? So when that patterning becomes fixed or static, we call that a "state of consciousness." And your mother probably told you, "Honey, you're only as good as your state of consciousness." How many of your mothers told you that? Yeah! OK. So if your mother was an Ericksonian, hopefully she'd tell you, in some way, "Honey, you're only as good as your state." And, and that's, by the way, that's why we're using hypnosis, in my view. We're trying to get people into a, into a better state of consciousness. Because they're saying, "Listen, I get into this state and I try my best to think my way through it, to act my way through it, but nothing's worked. I, I, I just keep ending up in the same-old/same-old." That's really the definition of a symptom, isn't it? One of them, anyway. So we're saying, "Wait. Before you approach that experience, let's shift your state." OK? That's why we do this "booga-booga-booga" stuff to get you into a different state and say, "Now let's approach that same challenge from this different state, knowing that it will produce a different outcome; it will produce different thoughts; it will produce different awarenesses." OK? So, if we have that basic sense of, "You've got a creative unconscious where everything's possible," and then you've got a conscious mind that actually brings into the world one actuality, then what we could say is that in a creative and healthy adaption there is a flow between the unconscious and the conscious. One of the disagreements I have about some of the Ericksonian, uh, if you want to call it, "dogma," is this notion that it's the unconscious that's creative. I don't think so. I would say, "If the unconscious is so creative, what is the person doing in the office?" You know? If it's so brilliant, why do they have so many problems? It was something about the way that Erickson talked about, talked to a person's unconscious that was a winning combination. When he'd talk to it in a particular way, then the unconscious began to get creative. So we could say, "Is it in the unconscious of the client? Is it in the brilliance of Erickson? Or is it in something about the connection between them?" So to say that, in normal, creative, healthy adaption is that you're going back and forth. We have a saying in American card playing, "You gotta know when to hold 'em, and when to fold 'em." OK? Gotta know when to take this position. I think this. I commit myself to this. I take that particular option. OK? And then you say, "This isn't working. I gotta let it go; go back to the drawing board. I g-, I need a new approach to things." OK? So I think that's intuitively pretty straight-forward. That's not rocket science. OK? That we, basically, the general idea is, "Do what you're doing until it doesn't work, and if doesn't work for a couple of attempts, let it go." We have another saying, "If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging." OK? So in a healthy process, versus, "OK, I need a break," or, "I've got to let it go. This obviously isn't working." And they go, what I would say, into the unconscious, they don't need a formal trance, but they go into, "What else is possible? What are the other ways of thinking about this?" That's what happens in normal, healthy process. Now we come to the great demon, uh, which I'm going to be calling, "neuromuscular lock." OK? So, what can happen very, very easily is that a person can get rigid. You know, my dear friend Bill O'Hanlon is sitting here, was, uh, we were laughing, he was telling me, when he was in graduate school he had a, um, a t-, a teacher, a class where they were t-, on a test, uh, d-, select some, some particular therapist and do 40 pages on how that therapist thought about the development of problems, and 40 pages on how they thought about the development of solutions. And Bill selected Milton Erickson. And he thought, "OK, how does Erickson think about the development of problems?" and he thought, and he thought, and he thought some more, and he said, "I can only think of one sentence." And as he was telling me I said, "Eh. Stop. I know what the sentence is: 'Psych-, people come to psychotherapy because they get rigid.'" He said, "That's right." OK? People come to psychotherapy because they get rigid. So this rigidity has a little fancier term: "neuro," of the brain image, gets locked, muscular lock. OK? This is why we say, "Relax." OK? Is to unbind the neuromuscular lock. You might say that neuromuscular lock has, has four major aspects to it. Take your pick. I-, th-, th-, the three eff, three traditional four effs have been elaborated by a lot of people in the trauma field to include a fourth eff, but they are agri-, fighting, fleeing, freezing, or falling asleep. So if your response to a particular challenge is to do this, or to do this, or to do this, or to do this. OK? You're shutting down access to the unconscious. OK? You're shutting it down and now you're stuck in that one, single conscious representation. Now you're stuck in the sense that, "Gap in the teeth means I'm so ugly I have to kill myself." Gap in the teeth, that's what, you know, something about what Freud was talking about a-, as a repetition compulsion. OK? So, what we're trying to do is to be able to move to the Fifth eff, from fight, flight, freeze, fall asleep to flow. Uh, and by "flow," OK, we don't mean the California airy-fairy flow, but what I would call a, a disciplined flow. OK. I, if, we, you know, a ch-, Csikszentmihalyi, who, who most people know as Dr. Flow, is it has done, you know, a beautiful 30-years-plus of research on, "What are the components of this experience of flow?" I would say that therapeutic trance is one of the best examples of, of therap-, of creative flow, what I would call, uh, "disciplined flow." OK? So how do we get back into the creativity of the unconscious? So, first week comes in and they say, "I'm stuck. I only have one way of viewing, one way of doing." And you say, "Well, just relax." And they say, "I can't. I'm too caught up in this problem." So here's where the genius of the utilization comes in. So we say that in the utilization there's two basic steps. This first step is what we call "creative acceptance." I use the word "creative" because it's not a passive, like, "OK. I guess. Whatever you want, it's OK with me," but it's a vibrant, creative sense of cre-, o-, of opening a space where whatever is there can be able to rest in it. OK? That's the first step, which is a deconstruction step. OK? It's, "Let it go." OK? "Come to mama. Come to papa. Let it go." That's all, you're only half way there, though. It's like where, wh-, in most hypnosis models we say there's the induction, which is a deconstruction, it's helping you to loose your mind, temporarily. And then there's the reconstruction, which is once we're in the unconscious, is that we've got to pop out a different frame that is more workable. And that's quite an art. OK? So it just doesn't come necessarily intuitively. So, this notion of the creative acceptance and, and transformation i-, is the, the creative acceptance, again, is this notion that trying to change something is the major means by which you keep it alive. OK? So this notion that resistance creates persistence. OK? This isn't always the case. Sometimes you try to change something, it works, you get on with your life. What we're dealing with in therapy are experiential patterns where the person has tried tried to change, has resulted in how the MRI crystallized Erickson's work, MRI Institute, of the attempted solution becomes the problem. OK? So the notion of creative acceptance is, "You find yourself in a hole. Stop digging. You trying to change hasn't worked, give it up." So the first step in change is not changing. OK? But again, it's not merely an intellectual thing, it's a deep acceptance of something. This process, to me, is really under-appreciated in Erickson's legacy and my view. Is that we've developed, I think, too much of an intellect-, overly intellectual, sort of cognitive view of what he was doing. So I think of it as this, as that you become a deep receptive field and you're interested in this more, I have a Chinese wife so this is the yin part of it, uh, you're interested in, in really becoming, uh, this open space where you can, again, have this sense of, "Come to mama," of, "Come to papa." OK? So, to do that you have to be in a certain state as the therapist. And I call this "cosmic consciousness," and as a Californian I'm here to bring you "cosmic consciousness." Very briefly, "cosmic" means "centered, open, connected to subtle energy, mindful, positive intention, and creatively engaging," that's "cosmic consciousness." OK? That's the therapeutic state. OK? "Centered," I'm underneath it so I'm not reacting to it. OK? I'm open so that my, my awareness includes the problem, but it's beyond the problem. I'm not locked into the problem. I'm interested in the problem and much, much, much more. OK? "Subtle" is what you need in order to have things flow. Anybody who does art. OK? Anybody who does something well knows subtle energy. Robert Dilts, I don't know if he's here, and I were teaching in Berlin some years ago and a brain surgeon who was in the workshop, uh, stood up and said, "God, I'm listening to you guys talk and talk," and he says, "I've finally realized, I've just realized why," he says, "my, uh, team and I do these very, very long, intricate brain surgeries, they're often 10 to 12 hours, and we play classical music and discuss philosophy." All right? These are Europeans. And he says, "I just understood why." Because you want your brain surgeon to have a subtle touch, right? If he's playing heavy metal music, you know, says, "Ah, close enough!" So to do anything at a high level is that you need subtle, the subtle awareness. OK? So the fir-, the change starts with the therapist's state. And if Erickson wasn't a good model of that, I don't know what he was a good model of. Uh, and again, it baffles me why people have, in my view, paid so little attention to what the Erickson state was. I think Jeff might be talking of a little bit, in terms of, of his keynote. But we do ver-, very little training on that. So what state does the therapist need to get in so that they can skillfully, uh, freely be able to accept, without getting overwhelmed, without reacting to it, but to be curious about what, what that is? OK?So again, thanks to Abby, is that we have this notion o-, o-, of this sort of two step process. So, "The gap in the teeth," OK, "means I should kill myself," that's our f-, our left panel. What we need to do is accept it so it goes into the field of infinite possibilities. And now we see, "Gap in the teeth. Wow! That could mean so many, many different things. Let me begin to count the ways." Wow. I just flashed. My unconscious just gave me an image of this woman squirting water through her teeth. I'm sure it wasn't the only possibility that Erickson entertained. OK? But in that sense of, "Just let it happen," there it was. OK? But then he's gotta be ab-, uh, you have to be able to assess, OK, which of these, OK, would really work best for this particular client. OK? So that's the second step. So once we open to the field of infinite possibilities is that we need to be able to have a sense of generating one that would really be meaningful for that particular situation. And remember what your hypnotic mother, hopefully will be telling you tonight in your dreams, "Honey, you're only as good as your state." OK? So what do you, what is your state that is allowing you to create these things that would be positive in a person's life? So what was Erickson perhaps thinking? Of, "OK, what would be, what would be a good life for her? What would be a positive life? Well, she, she wants to get married apparently. She wants to meet somebody. Uh, there's a guy that's interested at work." Of all the different possible meanings of the gap in the teeth, which one might lead to that particular positive outcome? And through that filter you could say, "Gap in the teeth," and something, and for me, something begins to resonate. Something inside my unconscious usually vibrates in my body as a way of saying, "That one! That one! Pick out that one! And think through that one." And like anything you might think, "Oh, you think through it, but, ah, it doesn't fit. Let's try another one. Let's try another one. Let's try another one." So that state, I generally, you know, always emphasize it in terms of, of the core of three things, and I was raised Irish Catholic, so it's always an application, like Catholicism, to say, "Here's a generative state. One, two, and three." OK? So the nuns and the Jesuits would be proud of me. OK? But you want to get centered. You want to get what Gendlin calls "a felt sense" underneath your verbal thinking. You want to have a positive intention. OK? You're not, you're not thinking in terms of, "What's wrong with this person?" You're thinking, "This person's on a journey. This person is on this interesting life path." Is that, "What could we do to be able to use everything that comes up to be able to go towards that?" And then you have this openness to do all of these positive connections. OK? So one way of thinking about this is kind of a little shorthand of, of the many different technical ways that we need to have available is something I call "the four step mantra." And the four step mantra, "mantras," of course, in quotes here. But when you find a strange symptom, or a pattern that seems to make no sense, you might find it very helpful, I certainly do, to be able to hold it in your breathing, in your f-, field of mindfulness, with these fa-, with these four simple hypnotic mantras. The first is, "That's interesting. That's really interesting. I'm curious about that." OK? How many of you were, were trained to be really curious about the positive value of symptoms? OK? "That's interesting." Second, "I'm sure this makes sense. Don't ask me consciously; I'm always the last to figure it out. OK? But I'm sure this has integrity for the person. I'm sure the unconscious," third, "is trying to help this person. OK? Something is trying to heal here. Something is trying to transform. Something is trying to wake up." And so therefore, and now the most important part, you say, "Welcome." A lot of times I way this straight-forwardly. Once I listen to a person, I breathe it, I find where I feel it in my body and I say, "So there's a presence inside of you." Say a person says, "I have panic." OK? And it, say, "That's interesting. I'm sure that makes sense." I find a way to bring it inside of me so I can hold it with curiosity and affection, and say, "So there's a presence inside of you that is filled with panic. I'd like to say to that presence, 'Welcome. Welcome. I, I'm sure that you're here to contribute something very, very important.'" OK? Now this might sound a little strange, uh, of shifting from talking about the problem in terms of the phsychopathological "it" language, uh, and we know that if you want to encourage violence against something, put it in dehumanized terms. OK? So, the most succinct formula, OK, so if you, you want to justify violence, is that, talk about it in the language of "it." If you begin to talk about it in human terms, is that you will no longer will be encouraged t-, to think in violent ways. So I was, suggest that if we can think about these symptoms in terms of these human presences - you could change it to different terms - but it's some living presence that is a part of the person. When we talk about it as, i-, in the third person, we begin to differentiate it from the witnessing presence. So rather than a person's, rather than saying, "You are panicked," you say, "There's something inside of you that's filled with panic. I'd like to say, 'Hi,' and I'd like to ask you to notice that when you experience that, what do you think?" So that we can begin to set up this relationship of the observing witness that can be present with whatever the symptom is. OK? How we doing for time, Roxie? Huh? Great. OK. So, I want to give you an example of this from, from my own practice and, and let it lead to the last point. This is sort of a question, I think, and you see it in the, uh, incredible difference between Ernie Rossi's version of Erickson and Jay Haley's version of Erickson. I mean if you read the two, sometimes you think, "Are they talking about the same guy?" I mean in some ways the weren't because it was a different era of Erickson, but according to Haley is that Erickson basically gave the patient directives. So he said, h-, Haley used to say, uh, what the interpretation was to psychoanalysis, the directive is to, uh, Erickson's work, and he called it, uh, uh, "directive therapy." OK? Now so it's, is, it's basically all the utilization is really, primarily in the seat of the therapist. If you look at Rossi's description, you hear the, these terms about the permissive utilization and the activation of creative potentials as if that, all the cre-, all the transformation is really being generated by the client. Which is it? I say, "Sometimes one, sometimes the other. Uh, usually some connection between them." But here's a little bit of a different example. A fellow came to seem me, and, um, he was an engineer, and he was married to a higher powered lawyer, and he was sort of, uh, a prototype engineer. Had lived his life from here, up. And, uh, I send out office forms that people have to fill out, and it includes a, a three page biographical sheet. And it's interesting how people fill these out. Some people fill out everything, and they, they write in the, the margins and add ten page addendums, and you think, "Oh. This is going to be interesting." Other people, like him, he used the faintest pencil and only answered a few things. "This is going to be interesting." So he came in and he said, uh, "I want you to use hypnosis to help me lift my procrastination." Try to get more information, he didn't want to go there. Try to get background information, he said, "Just do hypnosis with me." I didn't feel that comfortable, but I thought, "Maybe we'll get the ball rolling, do a couple of trances." We did. He came in on the third session and he said, "I have a confession to make." And I said, "What's that?" And he said, "I'm a sexual pervert." And I said, "Well, what does that mean?" And he, he said that he watched pornography six or seven hours a day; this was his "procrastination." You know, he, he worked at home, uh, as a consultant, and, uh, he was just on the computer all day. And he was so guilty, and he, i-, it was a whole elaborate sort of thing about it. And he said, "Can you help me?" Now as he said that, I was channeling Father McCarthy, my old Irish Catholic alcoholic priest, who was urging me to tell this guy to take five cold showers a day, and 50 Hail Mary's and 100 Our Father's. And I tried to explain to the good Father that my client was Jewish. He said, "Doesn't matter. Is it's the only solution." So I could, I could feel what that was doing to my state, so I thanked Father McCarthy for dropping by, and then went to the, the, the four step mantra of, "Relax. Don't react to it. Open to it. Be curious about it. Something is trying to wake up here. Something is really interesting about this." OK? Now this guy, as I said, tried to live from here, up. And his unconscious, I think, was saying, "Ah, ah, ah! Much more interesting than that." OK? So Jung used to say that the unconscious is always trying to balance the conscious mind. OK? And you say, "Well, i-, if that's trying to balance, why is it so negative?" OK? And we say, "It's negative because of the way that it is received by the human presence." So the sexuality comes up. Th-, the filter that's set is "sexuality is bad," is that that combination of the conscious and the unconscious produces a negative, ugly sexual expression. Fine. That's one way. So what we're looking to do is let it dissolve, let it deconstruct. How can you do that? Well, what I said to him, he said, "Can you help me?" I said, "Well, one thing I'm absolutely sure of is there is no amount of hypnosis, and no amount of psychotherapy, that will take away the fact that you have an amazing sexuality." I mean, this guy was doing everything to stop it, and it, it was, it was the Energizer Bunny. You know? "You have an amazing sexuality." He said, "Yes, but I'm ashamed." Receive that. Give it a place. You say let it come in to your center. Clean it off. Give it a human blessing. Reflect it back, "I, I see that as a sexual being, that there's a lot of shame. That's good to know, that that's there. And who else are you as a sexual being?" An he s-, flashed this smile and he said, "I'm really horny." Receive that. Give it a place. Give it a positive blessing. Reflect it back, "I see that too. That as a sexual being, you're really horny. OK. That's good to know. Who else are you?" We went through about seven or eight iterations of this. "I'm scared. I'm confused. I like to look at naked pictures." OK? Each one, make room for it. Give it a place. Give it blessing. And be able to bring it into community. OK? Then release. OK? After seven or eight iterations, y-, I'm sure you all know that sometime when clients do this wonderful work, this beauty begins to open up in them, you know? They just begin to have this glow. You know what I'm talking about? He looked so beautiful. This was the trance induction, if you w-, want to call it that, and we say, "Maybe it's a good time now to close your eyes, and let yourself take a breath, and let yourself begin to go on a healing journey where you can let yourself take all of these different parts of your sexual identity and let your unconscious weave them together into a new pattern. One that, in Erickson's terms, best expresses the needs and the resources and the capabilities of your present self." OK? He did it. He came out. He left. He came back next week. "How are you?" I said. He said, "I had a strange week," which is usually music to a hypnotist's ears. "What happened?" "Well, I had no urges to watch pornography. It was just very strange, but my wife and I, we had really intense fights every night, and we don't fight." They had been living on opposite sides of the house, sort of icebergs passing in the night. And I said, "This is his unconscious, in this view, guiding the therapy: It's with my wife." I said, "Well, why don't you, uh, I think maybe it's time to invite her in. And I often invite, uh, the partners in at some point." And he said, "Oh no," as ma-, most clients do, "I'm sure she won't come." "Well just let her know I invited her," I said, "It's really about talking about the future of her sexual happiness." She came. I did the rest of th-, the therapy with them as a couple, in terms of, uh, what that connection and, and, and all the g-, sexual connections, and, and so forth, and so on. OK? So, that to me is a, a little bit of a different example than the gap in the teeth. OK? And we see that, really, it was the client in, in my view, and what, the therapist, is that you are just receiving, and mirroring back, and holding a space, and then giving some sort of good timing direction about, "Let it all come. Let all the pieces be here. Let every part of who you are have a place here. And then when we're holing them all, go inside, and now let the unconscious do a healing." OK? That's what the unconscious is really good for. It accesses a lot of pieces and it's a good integrator. OK. So, just want to say that, uh, sometimes people hear that and they say whr-, when you talk about utilization or acceptance, "Are you saying you can accept and, and say, 'Everything is OK?'" You're not accepting violent, or, uh, antisocial, or things that are, uh, destructive to the person. The level at which you're accepting is the deeper pattern. So I wasn't saying, "Go ahead and do pornography for seven hours a day." What I was saying was that at the deeper level, this sexual energy is really something. OK? Uh, and, and I wouldn't want to stop that. What we can do here is make room for it, drop it back into the fluid state of the creative unconscious, and then see how it can be reconstructed. OK. So, that's p-, pretty much what I want to say about this utilization. It really is the gift that keeps on giving. You know, when I started, as Jeff said, I was 19, and I was just on the fast track and thought, "Ah. Oh, if I want to understand Erickson, it, it's utilization," and so I studied, and I studied, and I just did everything. I was 24/7. And it took me six months, which is a long time for 19-year-old, to, in my view as a 19-year-old, finally understand what utilization means. But finally I understood. And I was a little smug. And then two years later I had this sort of cataclysmic break and I realized, "That's not it at all. It's much more interesting than that. But now, now I understand" And of course, couple years later, "Oh, but now!" And somewhere along the way, realized there's never a final understanding. You can devote your whole life, as Erickson did, OK, to really being able to explore this, and at the end of your life you will appreciate that you have barely scratched the surface. OK? That's a good thing to know, huh?. That, that you can just totally, totally devote yourself and you will ne-, you will never stop being rewarded for that. OK? So, um, I want to thank you all for, uh, being here. I just, uh, I have one little poem to go. Always like to close with a poem. I hope I can remember this, we're coming back to Rumi. Uh, and I just want to leave you with this simple poem, and here's what Rumi has to say, "The breezes at dawn have secrets to tell you. Don't go back to sleep. You must ask for what you really want. Don't go back to sleep. All night long people are walking back and forth across the threshold where the two worlds meet. The door is round and open. Don't go back to sleep. Don't go back to sleep. Don't go back to sleep." Thanks a lot. Thank you. Thank you.
