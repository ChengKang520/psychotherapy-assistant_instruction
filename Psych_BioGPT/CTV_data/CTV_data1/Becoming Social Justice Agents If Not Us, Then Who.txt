ELIZABETH VERA  Uhm, so I wanna start our talk today, uhm, by just really giving you a sense of where social justice fits in to the, the history of multiculturalism and as I look out and see who's here, uh, this is gonna take about 30 seconds because I know that all of you are, you know, pretty much here because of your commitment to social justice. Uhm, so if I can have the first slide, please. Thank you. Uhm, so, just in terms of understanding social justice in context, uhm, certainly I think we would all be in fair agreement that with the emergence of multiculturalism really for more of a, of the fringe of psychology to, uhm, a fairly mainstream position, uhm, not only in psychology but in many disciplines we've been provided with an opportunity. Uhm, and it's an opportunity for us to discuss and debate and to really dialogue about what are the most effective means of improving the quality of life in marginalized community and we're talking about, you know, the poor people of color, GLBTQ communities. Uhm, essentially those communities which have been disenfranchised, uhm, from, in society in many, uhm, ways. And inevitably out of those dialogues I think that the need to com, combat social injustices, uh, has a reason and I think that, uhm, at this point within our, uhm, multiple disciplines there, there is a great degree of consensus that fighting those injustices at a systemic level is the direction that we really need to be going in and that's what, has been so exciting about this conference this year is that the, there's just a convergence of energy from many different, you know, aspects on great work that ACA is doing and, uhm, lots of things that are happening within educational research and, and counseling psychology. So, it's a, it's been a really exciting time, uhm, for this particular issue to be on the front burner. Uhm, next slide please. So, while I think we have this consensus of, of the direction of our work and where we need to be focusing our efforts, I think there's potentially a little bit less consensus about who really should be on the front lines of these efforts. Uhm, and so, in my presentation today, I really wanna talk specifically to issues of advocacy in public policy and to, to talk about some of the advantages and challenges that would be inherent in infusing systems change into our role as professionals, uhm, and into the, the day-to-day work that we do. Okay, uh, next slide please. And so, to start out I just wanna provide you with some working definitions of advocacy. There are many definitions in the literature so these are not necessarily, uh, representative other than, uhm, the ones that appear in multiple sources. So, for example, Trusty and Brown in a 2005 publication, uh, define the advocacy as involving the identification of unmet needs and taking the actions to change the circumstances that contribute to the existence of problems or inequities. Uhm, Field and Baker in 19, in 2004, uh, have also, uh, defined an advocate as a person who pleads to the cause of another or defense a cause. And then Caselica, Mark Selicon(ph) and his colleagues have done some, uhm, definition of advocacy counseling and they have defined that as an approach to counseling in which the counselor goes beyond the traditional verbal interventions to identify ways in which constituents voices are not being heard or voices are being devalued. And then, of course, the, the action as, uhm, action is, is follow up, uhm, to those identifications. And I think that in many ways, uhm, because of the emergence of, of discussions of advocacy in the literature, uhm, it's becoming a very legitimate part of our role as professionals and I think you do see some variance in that between discipline. So, for example, I think school counselors, for example, and social workers are very comfortable with the idea of advocacy as part of theirs, their professional identities. Ah, counseling psychology is also I think energizing around the advocacy as a role. Ah, in fact, uh, the 2001 Houston Conference of, of counseling psychologists, uhm, one of the major themes was social action via advocacy. And there were, uhm, some articles written in reaction to that conference that were published in 2004. Ah, one of the articles was written by students, uhm, but, Laura Mccray and, and her colleagues who's probably not a student anymore, uhm, and what, what those authors had to say in reactions specifically to social action, uhm, was that they, they felt that the, there was some confusion, uh, within our profession about what exactly advocacy is in counseling and what kind of trust, training would be necessary for us to feel competent in that role. Uhm, and I'll quote one, uhm, part of their article. They stated that rhetoric regarding reclaiming social action will remain just that unless our efforts are mobilized. In fact, that is far easier to speak of social action than it is to actually do it. And I think that, uhm, in many ways, we have some empirical support for that. Uhm, in 2004, uhm, Myers and Sweeney investigated counselors attitudes about advocacy and, uhm, they found that the majority of their sample were, were very agreeable that advocacy was a legitimate part of, of a role of a counselor. Uhm, but when they were asked about, uhm, who should be at the, at the front lines of advocacy, uhm, many of those same participants felt that it would be easier to hire someone to do advocacy, sort of, like a professional lobbyist. So there was this concern about, you know, our willingness to outsource advocacy to people that we feel are really competent and trained to do it as opposed to taking on those challenges our, ourself. Uhm, so, and I think that, uhm, there's, there's also been some work that, uhm, Michael D' Andre and Judy Daniels has done around, uhm, the view that of mental health professionals take around, uhm, integrating social activism into their day-to-day work and they, from very similar pattern that well most of their participants, uh, were very much amenable to the idea that social activism was a part, an important part of, uhm, our professional call. They found that less than one percent of us is actually engaged in any specific form of social activism. So, it's a very low percentage of us who have found a way to move from that rhetoric to reality. Okay. So, in this next slide that's already here for you, uhm, I did try to look and see if, if there, uhm, warps that is that looked at, uhm, what are curettes(ph) and predictors of social activism and the majority of this literature, probably, not surprisingly has looked at the views of college students. Uhm, so, for example, Lee in a 1997 publication and, uhm, he was looking at South Korean college students, uhm, found that having a liberal political ideology, being knowledgeable of grassroots activist organizations, uh, reading activist publications and being male, uh, happened to be the best predictors of social activism. Ah, Hurtado et al in 2002, uhm, actually found that women tended to have values that seemed more consistent with social activism and some of the values they measures, measured were things like humanism and empathy. Uhm, and in zero(ph), in an earlier study in 1990 found the connection between spirituality community service and social activism. Now, again, since all these studies were done with college students, it's hard to know of counselors who would say the same things although, uh, in 2005, uh, Nilsson and Schmidt, uh, did study of counselors in which they found that having an interesting politics and having an actual desire to be socially active, uhm, being social activist, social acts, activism is not that, uhm, were actually the best predictors of social, of actual activity. Uhm, one of the things that was probably the most interesting about the study is what they did not find to be a significant predictors. So, if you had training in activism that was not found to be significantly linked to your actual involvement, uhm, and they didn't find that there were any dispositions like altruism, uhm, that were significant predictors. So, we, we know that, uhm, you know, there, there some interest in trying to understand what would lead someone to engage in social activism or starting to get some of those questions answered, uhm, although I think what's probably most exciting is that as, as some of you heards to earlier talks today, uhm, we have actually started to define what competencies are necessary for advocacy within our profession and I wanted to talk with you today about, uhm, one set of, of advocacy competencies. I know that there are several, for example, ACA, uhm, has a working document of, of advocacy competies, competencies that some of you probably have. Uhm, I, I'm also gonna introduce to you some of the advocacy competencies that have come out of the National Association of School Counselors. Uhm, so if we can go to the next slide please. Uhm, so Trusty and Brown in 2005, uhm, published the list of, of their advocacy competencies and I also have all my references at the end of this talk if you wanna copy any of this down. I'm also happy to email you the power point. Uhm, so, the first set of competencies is looking at dispositions and, uhm, within this category there is four subsets of dispositions. The first is what they call advocacy dispositions and this is a lot of those attitudes that we've, uhm, talked about having come out of the previous research. So, having an altruistic motivation, uhm, being more of a humanist in your philosophy, uhm, but it's not just the desire to, to do good that is involved in advocacy dispositions, in fact, being willing to take risks is a very important advocacy disposition within this model. And interestingly enough, Trusty and Brown, uhm, have said that these advocacy dispositions are probably the most difficult to change. So, the least mutable of all the things that we're gonna talk about on this list. Uhm, the second set of dispositions are empowerment dispositions and that's been another major theme of the conference this weekend. Uhm, but really what they're talking about is, you know, the recognition that im, that clients, uhm, or in the case of children a lot of times parents and families are the best position to advocate for the needs of their children. And so, aligning with the parents and with the clients, uhm, is probably a more effective, uhm, strategy than it would be trying to speak for them on their behalf. So that, that really speaks to the issue of trying to help people find their voice and serving as a catalyst, uhm, in that process. Ah, they also describe social advocacy dispositions and what these are, is the recognition that there has to be advocacy in a larger systemic level that, uhm, being able to intervene within multiple forms of the system is an important part of, uhm, the world view that one needs to have to do this work. Uhm, then the, the next set of dispositions they call ethical dispositions and this is really thinking about the, the work of an advocate within the context of our ethics, uhm, and laws that applied to our profession. Okay, uh, next slide. 

00:12:40
 (inaudible ). 

00:12:41
ELIZABETH VERA Sure. 

00:12:41
 (inaudible ) is it possible to go over the, uh, ethics (inaudible )? (crosstalk) 

00:12:48
ELIZABETH VERA  Sure. 

00:12:50
 (inaudible ). 

00:12:52
ELIZABETH VERA  Okay. 

00:12:55
 (inaudible )? 

00:12:56
ELIZABETH VERA Yeah, no problem. Uhm, so the advocacy dispositions part of their, there are some attitude nuance including an altruistic motivation and having a humanistic philosophy. Uhm, but then in addition to the desire to do good is also their willingness to take risks. 

00:13:15
 (inaudible ) 

00:13:19
ELIZABETH VERA Sure, no problem. And I, I mentioned to you that these are so, probably the hardest to, uhm, to change which I think we can talk about as an issue regarding training where you can really kind of train people into those dispositions or whether they have to come to you with some of that interest. Uhm, but we'll look at to that. Okay, uhm, so knowledge is the next category of competencies and the first category of, of knowledge competencies is really about, uh, the knowledge of existing resources in the community. Uhm, so, knowing what the community strengths are, the various sources of social capital, uhm, as well as tangible resources that when used can really bring to bear, uhm, in advocacy situations, uh, a lot of, of strength. Uhm, so being knowledgeable about the community that you're working within and, you know, both the strengths and needs in those communities is really key to this particular competency. Ah, another competency is knowledge of parameters and what they're talking about here really policies and procedures that are relevant to the advocacy work that you're trying to do. Uhm, so, for example, if you're working within a school context knowing what the, especially what laws are or knowing what the rights of parents and, and students are within that context are gonna be critical, uhm, to helping you do this work and in part because a lot of times, uhm, parents don't know what those laws are, uhm, or, you know, don't really know how to advocate within, uhm, the set of policies that exist. Ah, another set of, of knowledge competencies is knowledge of, knowledge of dispute resolution. Uhm, this makes a lot of sense as you would imagine, uhm, being an advocate results in conflict and you're, sort of, jumping right into the heart of it. Uhm, and so, being able to, you know, feel comfortable not only with the conflict but also to have skill to resolve and negotiate some of those differences is critical and I think this is where the diplomacy peace comes in that, you know, it changes difficult but there's, as we've all been trained, uhm, there's, you know, easier ways to go about resolving some conflict. Uhm, and again, I think this is where you can really use your role as a catalyst, uhm, to, you know, help, help negotiate some of those, those nego, those, uh, conflict resolutions. Ah, the next category of competence is, is knowledge of advocacy models and this is really an understanding of the kind of the steps A to Z that you would take in engaging in advocacy work and I'm gonna hold off in talking about that 'coz that's actually, uh, the next topic I'm gonna move to. Uhm, and then the final competency in the knowledge category is knowledge of systems change. Uhm, so this is the ability to intervene at multiple levels of the system and I think again this is very discipline specific. Uhm, some of us are very comfortable with intervening at an individual level or of a family level or group level, uhm, than I think other disciplines are, uhm, better training us to intervene within a school context or a community. Uhm, but really this knowledge of systems changes and an, is an acknowledgement that we have work to do at those multiple levels. Okay. Uhm, let's go to the next slide please. Okay. The last set of competencies are skill-based competencies and some of these are very, very straight forward but I just wanna run through them. Uhm, the first one is, is having strong communication skills. Uhm, I was reminded a couple weekends ago of the same, uhm, that there is a reason that we have two years and one mouth. Uhm, the reason being we should listen twice before we speak once and I think that that's really key to being an effective advocate is not just your ability to persuade and, and, you know, find common ground in the midst of conflict but also your ability to really listen to a situation, uhm, and try to understand the nuances of what people are saying. Uhm, so, obviously, that's an important skill set. Collaboration is another important skill set. Uhm, to be an effective advocate you have to have strong relationships, uhm, in multiple of, arenas. You have to have strong relationships with the constituents that your partnering with, uhm, but you also have to have solid relationships with the policy makers and, uhm, the folks that you're likely to run into the most resistance from, uhm, and I think being open to multiple perspectives and being able to kind of, uhm, hear some of these multiple perspectives with respect or, or key to collaboration. Ah, problem assessment is another set of skills that this is what, it's, it's really important to be able to figure out the best way to measure, uhm, the situation or problem that you're trying to advocate on, uhm, so knowing what kind of data is gonna be most persuasive and how you would get those data. Uhm, and then also the ability to strategize how, how and when you use data, uhm, is critical here. Ah, another set of skills is, is problem solving skills. This is, uhm, similar to what we've been talking about but again I think what's key about having good problem solving skills is that you don't go into advocacy situation as the problem solver. You wanna go in as the, again, this, this catalyst idea that you're gonna help communities to figure out what this, what the solution is. Uhm, so, that's a critical aspect of problem solving within this context. Uhm, organizational skills is I think another, uhm, important issue regarding advocacy. It's, this is where really we're talking about logistics and we're talking about the planning and, and the data gathering and, uhm, you know, to be, ability to, uhm, follow up on particular, uhm, aspects of the process. Uhm, and then the final set of skills is self care which I think is often overlooked but as many of our speakers during the conferences have talked about, uhm, taking risks really comes at a personal cost for a lot of us. Uhm, and I think even when we're in solidarity with community constituents or with our colleagues and we've really joined forces, uhm, that can help offer some of the stress but it's a stressful situation, uhm, oftentimes trying to evoke systems change. Uhm, and so rather than, you know, burn out prematurely which is I think a risk of doing advocacy work, uhm, it's important to, to really take care of yourself if this is an important part of how you spend your professional hours. Okay. So, out of all these, uhm, skills I think, you know, if there's, there's clearly a pragmatic aspect of learning how to do advocacy but there's also I think a real dispositional aspect of, uhm, being, you know, having the willingness to take the risk that are necessary but also having, sort of, the diplomacy and ability to do so in a way that's likely to yield the outcome that you want. Okay. Alright. So, I said I was gonna talk about an advocacy model and that's the next, uhm, slide. There it is. Uhm, so this again is, is, uhm, coming out of, uhm, some of the, uhm, B-Mac(ph) and Chang literature as well as the, uh, Trusty and Brown. This is really a description of the different steps that might be involved in, in, in a particular advocacy endeavor. Uhm, and the first step really speaks to kind of getting yourself ready, uh, being, being in a place where your, you know, you, you feel that advocacy is part of your calling. It's an appropriate part of your professional role. Uhm, and, you know, again I said we were gonna talk about how trainable are these dispositions and there's a little bit of literature, uhm, Buckley, for example, uh, he's talked about converting people to become social justice agents, uhm, and some of his works says that really the first place to start is by exposing people to injustice and I think, probably, a lot of us have personal experiences of injustice that we don't really do, uhm, you know, ha, have a, uh, external exposure to injustice but external exposures to injustice are also, uhm, very viable ways of I think starting this process. He argues that that's not enough. It's not just exposure to injustice it's, uhm, also very important to have a way to conceptualize oppression and understand why oppression exist. Uhm, so, for example, reading some of Linda James-Myers work on optimal theory, uhm, you know, reading the theories you write about both depression and liberation are, are part of this intellectual aspect. And then the third part of this conversion that Buckley talks about is, is a skill set, feeling personally empowered that you have the tools and, uh, knowledge and skills necessary to really be an effective agent of change. So that would be involved with, uhm, this first step. The second step is this relationship piece that it's really important to develop advocacy relationships, uhm, and the knowledge of the community that's gonna make you an effective advocate. Uhm, so this is where, you know, sometimes fostering those long, those collaborations is a long term endeavor. Uhm, it's important to, uhm, you know, not just do one shot deals in communities but rather, you know, form an ongoing partnerships that not only established your trustworthiness and credibility better, I think really keyed of to feeling, uhm, a true sense of alliance and partnership, uh, with the communities that you care about. The third step is defining the advocacy problem and this is where gathering and using data is really critical. Uhm, really I think there's a key element to one's credibility and, and being able to document your, your cause or document your, uhm, your argument. Uhm, lots of people feel passionately about things and, and have lots of anecdotal evidence to, for trying to, they used to persuade but, uhm, a lot of times if you're going to, uhm, you know, administrators and, uhm, policy makers having numbers or, or different forms of data can be very effective. So, that would be the, the third step. The fourth is developing your actio, action plan and this is your strategy. This is where you answer those logistic questions about who's gonna be involved, when am I gonna try to intervene, where is it gonna happen. Uhm, and really, you know, lay, laying out with your, in collaboration with your constituents, uhm, how we're gonna go about advocating for what we want. And then the next steps involve, you know, implementing the plan which is where you use those skills that we talked about. Uhm, evaluating the outcome of your work and then, uhm, regrouping. And I think what's inherent in the evaluation in regrouping stages is understanding that a lot of advocacy work is small steps that very, very rarely is at one iteration of a change process. It's usually, you know, we got one thing that, that helped and that made a difference but there's a lot more to do. So, we're gonna have to come at this again from another angle. Okay. Uhm, I think part of which, at this point in our, in our, uhm, field is, is that it's clear that until there's opportunities for a lot of formal training, in other words, you know, we have training programs that, uhm, you know, there's advocacy course work or advocacy practicum. Uhm, it's gonna be those informal opportunities that are gonna be really critical to energizing, uhm, people who are wanting to engage in advocacy work. And Field and Baker talked a lot about that that, uhm, you know, starting where you are is a really important part of learning to do advocacy, trying to make a difference where you are. So, looking for ways you can advocate on your university campus or in the school that you work in or in the community that you're, uhm, you know, in, in, in a practicum, for example, and, uhm, that that's, that's where you start to really engage in this process. Okay, uh, next slide please. Okay, I wanna shift gears just a little bit to talk more specifically about public policy advocacy. Uhm, public policy advocacy is a role, uh, for education in psychology and mental health professionals, uhm, again there's something that I think has some appeal, uhm, but there's some questions out there about is it, is it appropriate. I think those that we've read some of Laura Brown's work know that history of psychology is sort of one that, uhm, encourages a political, uhm, affiliation. We're more comfortable just, sort of, being trying to be neutral even though that that's not really possible. Uhm, so there have been some interesting articles of, for example, won by Frosten Aleth(ph) in 2004, uhm, that they really believe that, you know, since psychology does already have a history of lending its voice to palsy debates on major social issues like Brown versus Board of Education and affirmative action. Uhm, it makes sense that we would want to be as active as we can, uhm, in making sure that, uhm, our public policy is driven by science. Uhm, so, you know, figuring out whether what we know, uh, from the literature within our various series of expertise is consistent with what policies are being developed towards to what extent it contradicts policy should be our ethical obligation as professionals. But I think the other issue that comes up is potentially this natural tension that may exist between scientist. So, for example, educational researchers, social scientist and people who enact policy or policy makers. Uhm, there's a, a good article, a 2005 article by Choi et al. Uhm, they have a paper that's entitled "Can Scientists and Policy Makers Work Together?" And I think that, uhm, next slide please. Uhm, we're gonna talk a little bit about, uhm, their paper but the, I think, uh, there's an intuitive answer of yes, you would hope that policy would be informed by science. Uhm, that that should be the goal of legislators is to make evidence based policy decisions. Uhm, however, I think that it's, scientists are somewhat skeptical about the extent to which researchers really use to make policies and then policy makers are skeptical about the usefulness of a research. Uhm, so, as a result, uhm, Choi et al would argue that there's probably no correlation between the quality of science and the quantity of public policy that's derived from them. So, I wanna talk about the tension that exist between these two worlds of policy makers and, and scientists briefly, uhm, and some of these are over generalizations but I think, uhm, they're, they're good, uhm, stimulus for, for thinking about these issues. Uhm, Choi et al would argue that researchers have an agenda, uhm, when we engage in our science and our agenda typically about publications and professorships and oftentimes social scientist, educational researchers are accused of learning everything there is to know about practically nothing and we wanna go for narrow expertise, uhm, not breath in what we know as professionals. Whereas policy makers have a very different agenda. Uhm, they often live in a world that involves putting up fires, managing political crisis and their general preference is to know a little bit about a lot of things. Uhm, so they actually prefer broadness in scope not depth. Uhm, also, policy makers prefer clear-cut answers. They don't like caveats, uh, they really want the essence of an issue laid out preferably in bullet points. So, they prefer a bottom line and I think scientists, you know, we equivocate, uhm, we're uncomfortable giving bottom lines. We don't like giving bottom lines to clients. We don't like, uhm, you know, having to give a, uh, uhm, you know, uh, answer that box(ph) is a sin. We'd like to have that flexibility. Ah, one of my colleagues at Loyola, James Carbonero, his a developmental psychologist, uhm, always talks about the best answer you can give a client or a parents or policy maker in, in response to any question about, uhm, psychology is it depends. Uhm, so, if a parent comes to you and says, "You know, is there a problem that my child is, you know, not talking in full senses by a particular age?" Well, it depends it could be a problem but it might not be a problem and I think that, uhm, the world that, re, most researchers living we prefer that, that, it's not really ambiguity but the ability to, uhm, answer questions in multiple ways. We're comfortable with the ambiguity. Uhm, another tension is that scients, scientists stand up and says about the quality of evidence, uhm, that oftentimes we get very fixated on the methodology that was used, obtain evidence or the number of studies that are available on the topic. Uhm, that that we get very, uhm, stuck, uhm, about, you know, making statements about, uhm, particular psychological outcomes based on those issues whereas policy makers are much more comfortable using potentially more informal types of evidence. So policy makers ever uncomfortable going off of data that they get from focus groups, uhm, or poll results, uhm, that, that, that's, sort of, enough evidence at times for them. And I think when you think about these tensions and potentially, uhm, built in differences in world view, it, it can, sort of, paint an oblique picture. Uhm, however and this is on this current slide uhm, interviewer uhm, and colleagues did find that policy makers are open to using research in the development of their legislation uhm, but they're sort of three caveats. They, they prefer when the research is timely so that when the research papers that we're producing are really addressing current social needs uh, it's more likely to fall into their hands. They're more likely to read it. Uhm, second if there's a personal contact between researches, researchers and policy makers then uhm, they're more likely to value what we have to say. And third, uhm, if we include clear summaries of policy implications within our research that to them is close enough to a bottom line. Uhm, next slide please. So therefore, if you think about this uhm, what this means for us is that we're most likely to influence public policy when we're asking relevant socially meaningful research questions, when we're willing to foster relationships with policy makers and when we're able to infuse policy implications into our scholarly products. Uhm, so it kinda raises the question of what would it be like if in our journal articles uhm, just in the same way that we're required to describe methodology and we're scri, required to talk about limitations, that we would also be required to talk about policy implications. Uhm, and, and I don't know if, if we're gonna get to that point but it, it's encouraging us to think about uhm, the discussion of our, our findings at, in a larger context. Okay. Uhm, McCarthy and Rosenthal in a 2000 article argued that sort of like it or not, social scientist need to be cognizant of the fact that real life decisions that affect real people are influenced by the papers that we write, oftentimes regardless of our intent. Uhm, so it behooves us to use methodologies and tools that uh, are more applicable to policy makers. So that when we uhm, write papers we, we should think about instead of just hypothesis testing, we should be talking about effect sizes. Uhm, we should be looking at the possibility of doing cost-benefit analysis. About the, the programs that we're testing in terms of efficacy. Uhm, so using language that's more easily transportable into that world of policy makers. Okay, our next slide please. So I wanna start to wrap up so that we can have time for a little discussion. Uhm, in terms of final recommendations, I think that you know, where we're left is that in order to really move from rhetoric to reality, we have to start creating opportunities and again I don't think we can wait on formal opportunities before we really jump in to, to uhm, start with some of this advocacy and public policy work. Uhm, we need to uhm, take advantage of informal opportunities. Some of those opportunities might be uhm, because in your community you're aware of groups that are involved in advocacy at the grassroots level uhm, or uhm, within your profession you know, ACA, APA, there's you know, fractions, or factions of people who are involved uhm, in doing particular types of policly, policy work or advocacy. Uhm, one of the reasons I wanted to address this topic today is that I, I get asked to uh, address groups of interns and students uhm, on topics of social justice and inevitably and I don't know if it'll happen today. But inevitably what happens is that uhm, people will say, "Well, I like what you're saying but I don't really think that I should be the one engaging in this activity. I haven't been trained, I haven't been supervised. It would be uh, unethical for me to engage in anything that I'm not competent." And, and there's a real hesitation and I think uhm, when we take that logic towards extension, it means that we're gonna have a long wait before people are willing to become active as uhm, social justice agents and engage in advocacy. And I would argue similar to what Thomas Parham and others have really passionately argued that we don't have that time to wait. That there's too much on the line. There's too much, literally lives losts uhm, uhm, in our, our waiting for that to happen. Uhm, so that's, that's one of the things that uhm, I think can sometimes stop us from being willing to take those risks. Uhm, I liked what uh, Dr. Parham said today, you know, kind of asking yourself the question of unusual are you willing to be. Uhm, and like I said I think, the fact that there's so many people at the conference this weekend talking about advocacy uhm, it's, it's really powerful. It says that there's you know, there's a synergy right now. Uhm, so for those of us who are so moved(ph), there are those opportunities. And even if the opportunity is not at your particular university, there are those of us who enga, are engaging in this efforts and we always want allies. Uhm, so that's, I think this is a good time to be on this topic. Uhm, you know, I would encourage all of you uhm, you know, to really try to become that change that you wanna see that's Gandhi. Uhm, so, to, to really, uh, like I said there's so many others have so, elegant, eloquently stated uhm, to, to feel empowered, to take those risks and to look for allies uhm, you know, this weekend if you don't already have them that are really willing to support you in that work. So I will stop here and see if we have any questions. Could you actually uhm, advance the next couple of slides slowly 'coz there's references on there. I don't know if people want them and like I said can e-mail you this power point if there's uhm, articles you'd like to look at. So any questions or reactions from any of you? Yes. 

00:37:15
 Could just, could everybody hear me? 

00:37:15
 Use(ph) the microphone. 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:20
 (inaudible ). Uhm, as a counselor sometimes I wonder, there's a lot of talk about counseling(ph) and slap(ph) you back and just going in sort of verbal interventions, dimensions and all those likes(ph). Guess I was wondering if you could give us some examples of being (inaudible ) being an advocate, would accomplish counseling to a child(ph). . . (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
ELIZABETH VERA Child(ph). 

00:37:45
 . . . who is not overly political? 

00:37:50
ELIZABETH VERA Not overly political? (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
 It's, meaning increasing(ph) formally political. (laughs) Meaning not talking to politicians of things you do. You know, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
ELIZABETH VERA Okay. Local, sort of, okay, sure. Yeah. I mean, I have examples of both that have been able, fortunate enough to be involved in. Uhm, I think you know, well, thinking about school based context is a really rich source about, opportunities to engage in advocacy work. Uhm, so I think you know, probably most of us at some point working uhm, with kids as well as adults come up against the limits of that individual work that you've been talking about. And you start to see that there's some real lack of resources that kids uhm, need. So for example uhm, some of the schoolwork that I do uhm, you know, we work in communities where uhm, the kids don't have many after-school activities. School itself doesn't provide very many aft, after school activities and you end up with many kids just hangin' out with nothing to do. Uhm, you know, one way to advocate for that could be to you know, collect some survey information about how our kid's spending their at, their free time. Uhm, those specific kids in that neighborhood uhm, and then you know, going to, for example you might start with you know, school administrators and talk to them about you know, what, what this information says and uhm, is there a possibility of increasing the amount of after-school programs that are available for kids. If not uhm, you know, for example in Chicago, we could go to our uhm, sort of city level politicians. I know what, we, you're, it's not talking of politics but uhm, and you know, talk to the park district about the need you know. And, and we'd ask kids how many of you would go to a program if it existed. So we would be able to collect information that might persuade them to initiate uhm, some programs that we think would be beneficial to kids' mental health. Uhm, or you know, keeping them engaged in some more productive types of activities. Uhm, so after-school activities could be one example. Even within schools uhm, I work, there's very little mental health for the kids. So its a school of 1,100 kids and they have a uhm, very part time social worker who's there by the day in a half a week. Uhm, so when we have kids they have mental health needs uhm, oftentimes you know, the principal will say, "We'll, just we'll just refer the Mom to the community." Well, it's very easy to collect data that the kids don't go. Uhm, their parents don't take them so they're not served. Uhm, whereas if we could uhm, use those data than to persuade the school to uhm, go the school board you know, and be able to get the funds that they would need so documenting that kids would need these services and would use these services would be another way of advocating for uhm, something that would take us above and beyond just individual work. Does that make sense? 

00:40:40
 Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
ELIZABETH VERA Okay, sure. Other questions? 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:50
  What is a question to the through the whole conference that is neither, I think you're one of the first people I've heard who has talked about actually, speaking about parameters and not the resource(ph). Don't you think it sort of sounds like looking at this from somewhat realistic perception. What are, what do you have that you can work with in terms of social advocacy? Uhm, and saying the school system and(ph) children. Did you have uh, or a teen, do you have a teenager who is considering to drop(ph) him out of school because of conflict at home. Uhm, in your desires to sort of try and go help(ph) you know, the person and to see her needs or (inaudible ), I mean you have to kind of realize there's conflict(ph) from where she, she's coming from. 

00:41:40
ELIZABETH VERA Uh hmm. 

00:41:40
 Uhm, when those interest conflict, social advocacy versus you know, fostering the, the multicultural respect of the person that you're working with. How does that, how do you that? How do you do the most (inaudible ) uhm, interest about(ph) others? 

00:41:57
ELIZABETH VERA  I think so. So you're saying if the, the context of the client puts up barriers to the kind of, so keeping the kid in school. 

00:42:05
 Okay, now, this is just. . . (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
ELIZABETH VERA  Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
 . . .in a great(ph) and you're contacted in phone(ph) one from my (inaudible ) normal life from uhm, international study(ph). Clamor(ph), clamor(ph) from the universities. It's an international student who has a cultural context that might not allow the kind of social advocacy that change the environment(ph). I'm having a (inaudible ) so, if I give you a cultural perspective, this person deserves to be validated and yet some aspects and perspective, certain harmonizing(ph), I mean that there's a conflict there. 

00:42:35
ELIZABETH VERA  Uh hmm. 

00:42:40
 Then would I pick, pick advocacy or will I pick uhm, cultural (inaudible ). 

00:42:45
ELIZABETH VERA Uhm, I mean I think, I, I think if I'm understanding your question, it's, it's a fairly complicated question in the sense of you know, it sounds to me like you're wondering is it okay to push an agenda if it's maybe inconsistent with the client's world view or uhm, cultural frame of reference. And again I think you know, it's important to remember within an advocacy sch, uhm, model that you know, we're really talking about uhm, being a catalyst so hopefully it wouldn't come down to sort of your will against the client. It would be about collaborating with uhm, maybe not just that client but maybe the clients family if that, if there is access to the family but trying to find the, the solution to a problem that, that it fits best the circumstances. Uhm, even if it's not exactly what you want. I think you know, earlier in the talk I talked, I mentioned that uhm, I think we have to look at changes a multi-step process. That you know, the change you might want, might be at Step 10. Uhm, but can you be happy at step one which maybe just starting that conversation, planting the seed uhm, that things could be different or don't have to be like that. Uhm, I don't know if that helps at all but, but, yeah, just, I think you know, looking at some, looking at advocacy is a long term process. Uh hmm. Yes? 

00:44:05
  Uhm, I wonder you mention in, in talking about the advocacy dispositions, I think it was, absolutely probably some components that perhaps might project to be greater victors(ph) of uhm, sort of actually participating in advocacy versus uhm, endorsement theory. I'm wondering if there's, if you know, uhm, if there is anywhere in Sheryl Brown's(ph) folks who aren't articulable(ph) from things with cultural values. I'm thinking that people who have uhm, a more individualistic, cultural frame of reference, that it might be prior(ph) (inaudible ) more uhm, something. I'm not sure in terms of, to actually do the work in terms of doing advocacy versus folks who are working you know. (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
ELIZABETH VERA Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
 Uhm, in terms of their growth and I'm wondering if there's anything (inaudible [00:45:01.289]). (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
ELIZABETH VERA Well, that's a great question and I mean there's uhm, you know, in the study that Nielsen(ph) and Schmidt(ph) did, I think that one of the focus uh, one of the research questions that they ask was whether there are gender differences or uh, racial difference. I know in their study, they didn't have a large sample of, for example people of color. I think that they did find that uhm, people of color were uhm, more willing to engage in the work. You know, said that they had a stronger desire but they didn't find that they were more actually involved so that makes sense. So there was, I think that like you, to your point of, the attitudes or the willingness was there. Maybe in differential levels but uhm, not in terms of the actual behavior. Uhm, but again that was a study where they didn't have a large sample uhm, of therapist of color and again they were students so it's also hard to say how much actual opportunity they had had to engage. But I think is a, this a type of research that's about to blow up. I think there's lots of people that are asking those questions empirically at this point. So we'll probably know the answer to that soon. Uh hmm. Doctor Reynolds(ph)? 

00:46:10
 I was thinking about the training part and it seems to me that I can see almost integrating is easier with my masters or the students wherein schools are communicative at all and also my doctor students. Who, because of the tight line of going through internship. . . (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
ELIZABETH VERA Yeah. 

00:46:20
 . . .or the practicum experiences that they have, they don't really get the space to come, sometimes practice the skills and developing. So I like the idea that, and then ACA and many people in APA, we can move in that way because we also need doctor level individuals. (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
ELIZABETH VERA That's right. 

00:46:40
 I grew uh, working in agencies, offices and school counselors are already doing this. People on, in many community at the (inaudible ) are doing this. 

00:46:50
ELIZABETH VERA Uh hmm. 

00:46:50
 So I, I'm just struck by that thought. 

00:46:50
ELIZABETH VERA Yeah. And I think that that raises a really important point that we're not gonna change our professions just from a training director's perspective. I think we need to work with you know, the, the folks who train our students in prac, to come in internship in APAC(ph) and it, those associations so that uhm, you know, wha, what the advocacy work that our students might want to engage in counts you know, in a formal way. That it doesn't hurt them if I spend the semester doing advocacy. It doesn't hurt me 'coz now I'm not spending a semester doing individual therapy and losing hours. And so I think that's a real critical issue that as long as the system is what it is, you're right. It does sort of overwhelms students. And I think even though uh, earlier today Dr. Parham talked about you know, sort of being doubly trained, there are some practical realities of that. But I, I really do believe that if we're working in partnership with uhm, the internships and the practical who set the rules, I know maybe we can uhm, create the change that, believe that, that really is a multiple level. So that we can get doctoral students you engage in the work and it doesn't hurt them. It doesn't feel extra, it doesn't feel on top of everything else they have to do. Uh hmm, Doctor Spike(ph)? 

00:48:00
  So can uhm, can outsiders from various communities be advocates? You and I have this ongoing conversation about insiders and outsiders. (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
ELIZABETH VERA Yeah. 

00:48:15
 And how much you have to be an insider. So can you just, can you tell me about that a bit? 

00:48:20
ELIZABETH VERA Yeah. I think uhm, there's a lot of politics about being an insider versus an outsider. Uhm, I think uhm, probably when I talked a lot about the, the work that you have to do to establish relationships uhm, you know, to make yourself as close to an insider as you're likely to get. I think that it is probably harder uhm, it's, it's a, it's easier to uh, make those collaborative relationships I think uhm, when you have some shared life experience. Oftentimes that can be a bridge to kind of getting, getting into a position where you can do the work to establish the relationship. However, I don't think that that's sufficient. I think that uhm, for example those of us who are affiliated with universities, regardless of our gender, race and even our you know, background in terms of social class, we still come in as representatives of the university and that means something. You know, in a lot of communities that's not a good thing. Uhm, that we have to sort of look at the history of those earlier relationships and start by acknowledging uhm, those past mistakes. Uhm, and it is I think, your issue about you know, can outsiders ever really get in and, and be effective on the inside. Uhm, you know, I'd like to hope yes, but I, I don't think it's by pretending that you're not an outsider if that makes sense. I think you have to acknowledge that you know, uhm, I remember working in a community with uhm, a woman who uhm, for example it was uh, African-American group of kids and I was the only Latina on the research team and uhm, so she had an issue with you know, me saying, "Well, they're never gonna accept you." And what she was really counting on was the fact that she had been raised in the same in the community. Uhm. . . 

00:50:05
 She was a team member? 

00:50:05
ELIZABETH VERA She was a team member. Uhm, African-American woman and she was you know, concerned that I was never gonna get that insider status uhm, but I think what ended up also being a reality is that she didn't grow up in the community when this kids were growing up in the community. So there was this sort of natural starting point but she still had to do a lot of work to understand what was really going on right now for this kids. Uhm, so an, you know, it's a complicated question than a complicated answer. Uhm, but I think acknowledging your outsider status is do you have to start there. And whether that's in terms of race or class or uh, lot of other things you know, you gotta be willing to go there with the constituents. Yes? 

00:50:50
 Is it also possible for you to impersonate(ph) things that you advocated for your client in going with this against and the(ph) members you know, something that and individual just not going through a difficult condition(ph) and (inaudible ) important for the client when you're just (inaudible ) uhm, that it's very difficult and it's happening with the members situations(ph). 

00:51:25
ELIZABETH VERA Well, and that's why I think you know, I think about what some of what Doctor Parham talked about earlier that you know, waiting for permission to, in the case that you're talking about, I mean we do the right thing for the clients that's probably gonna be a long way. So at some point I think you have to make a decision about you know, am I willing to live with the consequences of doing it anyway even though it's gonna really upset my supervisor. Uhm, you know or am I willing to live with the consequences of not doing it 'coz I also think that there's harm that occurs there you know, when your clients feel that you're not gonna be with them along the whole journey. So I think it's you know, it's, it's not a win-win it's, you just have to figure out where you're more comfortable. 

00:52:05
 That (inaudible ) to yourself. 

00:52:10
ELIZABETH VERA Yeah. That'll be, yeah. Like I said this is a, this is a costly endeavor. It's not easy uhm, there's lot's of risks you take in terms of jeopardizing you know, how other people see you. Uhm, pumping hands with people who you know are maybe in a you know, as an employee-employer dynamic there. Uhm, so it's, it's risky. 

00:52:30
 I just wanted to add the same time I think the other times there are fear. . . (crosstalk) 

00:52:35
ELIZABETH VERA Uh hmm. 

00:52:35
 . . .and that uhm, their. . . (crosstalk) 

00:52:35
ELIZABETH VERA Might happen. 

00:52:35
 . . .response will be. . . (crosstalk) 

00:52:35
ELIZABETH VERA Uh hmm. 

00:52:35
 . . .sometimes outweighs the actual outcomes. IF we have uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:52:40
ELIZABETH VERA So we over, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:52:40
 Yeah, We over uhm, sympathizing. (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
ELIZABETH VERA Uh hmm. 

00:52:45
  You know, possibly with the repercussions or certainly there are repercussions and there are times when they are slipping uhm, fast. But I think a lot of times its you know, us thinking "Oh my goodness, this is under the fire. I feel some (inaudible ) job, I'm going to lose everything." (inaudible ) when you know, that, I can relate it's a lot more complex for that. A lot of times the repercussions can be far more subtle, maybe less comfortable in the workplace but you know, you'd really gonna lose your job or gonna lose that promotion. Uhm, and I think that that's important to consider as well. 

00:53:25
ELIZABETH VERA Yeah, that's a good point. It's either(ph), it's easy to give away our power sometimes when we don't need to. Uh hmm. 

00:53:30
  Uhm, I have a question about advocacy dispositions and the idea that you can be taught. Uhm, I wonder if you could say a little bit more about that and whether, if somebody wants to learn them, then they can be taught. (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
ELIZABETH VERA Yeah. 

00:53:45
 Or if it is you know. (laughs) 

00:53:45
ELIZABETH VERA No, it's a good distinction. Yeah, I mean converting people who wanna be converted versus forcing people who don't care. Yeah, that's a big difference. And I, I think you know, again we probably, I, I agree with you. I think if someone is really wanting to uhm, incorporate this as a part of their professional identity, they're open to going through the experiences that will make them effective agents of change, absolutely. Uhm, I would say that that's a trainable situation. Uhm, I think it's far more difficult when you have someone who's uhm, has to be convinced that it's important. Yeah, so it's a very good distinction, thank you. Any other questions? Doctor Spike(ph)? 

00:54:25
 I was gonna ask you to tell us the ad, tell us an advocacy story. Isn't it? (laughs) You know I love stories. 

00:54:30
ELIZABETH VERA  An advocacy story? Sure. (laughs) Uhm, well, one thing that I was able to do uhm, with uh, student in our doctoral program is uhm, there was uhm, some media attention that was put on school dropout uh, in Illinois and in Chicago in particular. it was really alarming. Uh, Latino boys, you know, 60 percent dropping out of school and not graduating uh, Latino girls 40 percent. And so the uhm, education caucus of Illinois State uh, legislature uhm, wanted to have an open public hearing and they, you know, were wanting to kinda get public input about why our kids are dropping out of school and what can we do about it. and uhm, those hearings are you know, in fact open to the public and you know, you go there and you sign up to talk and it's first come first serve and uhm, what I was able to do uhm, again with one of my students was we put together a you know, one page two-sided summary sheet of this is what the literature says about Latino school dropout. Uhm, these are uhm, some of the data that we have and these are some specific, bullet-pointed recommendations uhm, that we would say you know, we would make it to policy makers about this issue. And you know, those are things you don't have to be invited to do. You can do them. So if you're aware of them and like you said sometimes your awareness comes from your own personal motivation, that this an issue you care about and so kinda stay in touch with politically. But other times there's organizations in the community or within in our professional associations that are monitoring this issues for us. And so, I know some of you probably get e-mails from group saying, "We need people to contact politicians about issue x." I mean, they sometimes make it really easy for you do that with phone numbers or you know, templates of letters. Uhm, but other times like I said, you know you can uhm, decide that you, this is a, this is a situation in which you wanna be heard. Uhm, and again you know, it's not a guarantee that the situation is gonna be changed in the way that you want but it's, it's doing something that's being active. It's saying, "I'm putting my professional uhm, opinion out there and, and hoping that somebody reads it uhm, or hears it so. And there's like I said lots of you know, ways you can take meetings with politicians at state and local, in national levels and uhm, try to be as active as you can about educating those individuals. And it's actually interesting, a colleague of mine and I uh, and I participated in a coordinated advocacy campaign uhm, as part of our oppositions on the uh, Community for Ethnic Minority Affairs in APA and so we all went to our, our senators. Uhm, and were, we're tracking a, a bill that... 

00:57:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:57:25
ELIZABETH VERA ...was coming through the House on uhm, health disparities. Men(ph) looking at uhm, ways that we could educate legislators about the importance of for example training more practitioners of color and uhm, you know, making, having written intent to the legislation that you know, racism has harmful psychological and, and physical health defects. Uhm, and one of the outcomes from my colleague is that uhm, the meaning went well and the chief of staff you know, followed up and said, "Could we contact you on other uhm, issues that might have mental health implications." So they actually were looking for some alliances and some help uhm, which he only found out by taking that risk to go out there and then make that meeting. So, like I said a lot of times you know, you'd be surprised at the doors that open up. Are those good enough stories? (laughs) Okay. All right. Anything else? 

00:58:20
 Yes. Uhm, thank you for your comments. (inaudible ) questions that I have. Would you talk about it or about how might educate people in, in advocacy dispositions and how you might, if you see people that converted so to speak (laughs) that(ph) far? 

00:58:40
ELIZABETH VERA Yeah, but I, yeah, I, that, that's uh, question. I do think, yeah, I have seen people get converted. I think they were wanting to be converted. Uh, to connect back to your earlier point. I think though it doesn't in the classroom. You know, it's really important uhm, at the university I, I meant(ph) you know, we really value service learning. So getting involved in actual projects in the community uhm, my faculty colleagues and I you know, we have those connections to make those opportunities possible for students. Uhm, so I think it has to be, in, in my experience it's most effective if its experiential. Uh, it's really hard to do it without the books. Uh, it's really hard to kinda intellectualize it and make it happen. I think there's gotta be a real world component to it. Uhm, so, and there's actually a lot of writ, law written about that. Uhm, More(ph) and Kenny(ph) for example at Boston College so I can give you some reference about that. Anything else? 

00:59:35
 Can I ask one more thing? 

00:59:35
ELIZABETH VERA Sure. (crosstalk) 

00:59:35
 (inaudible ) 

00:59:39
ELIZABETH VERA Yeah. (laughs) I can't, it's greats 'coz I can't see you 'coz the light is right in my eyes so. . . (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
 It's alright. Okay. Uhm, (laughs) my other question is shouldn't(ph) there be any limitations or do you suggest that we should limit it in something existential(ph), we should rather base policy on science. I mean there are cases where the outcomes that we want to see don't necessarily have scientific evidence supporting them. What? Are we still gonna(ph) advocate for them? 

01:00:00
ELIZABETH VERA Well, that's a good question. I guess I have never really thought about that. Do you have any examples? 

01:00:05
 I guess the, the scenario I think that was where scientist on the other side well, wants their evidence that suggest that you know, that contradicts what you're saying. Not, not when there's no evidence of, supporting some of the things that we want. Just when there's(ph), I mean the Bush administration claims to have scientists that are supporting(ph) (inaudible ). I mean people would read only journals that kind about saying science has, have conflicted(ph) opinion on this uhm, it doesn't, it doesn't warrant snag(ph) (inaudible ) reaction? 

01:00:43
ELIZABETH VERA  Well, yeah, I mean I think it's, you know, science can be manipulated. You can highlight the statistics that support your point of views. That's the danger you know, I think in uhm, you know solely using that, that argument maybe without uh, ethical or moral component to that. I mean and, and that's, that's the complication I think of of some of the type of change that we're talking about is that uhm, there are folks out there who've used science against you know, people that were talking about advocating for uhm, so that's, you know, that's uh, I think an issue that uhm, I don't know, it's, it's harder to resolve that. I think you know, we can probably can push for a more of a full picture of what you know, what science is out there uhm, so that there might be a small fraction of studies that support you know, this particular spe, perspective but have, have we looked at the other ones that you know, counter indicate that particular policy uhm, or perspective. But that's, that's a really good point and and a good question. Anything else? Thank you all so much. I really appreciate your coming(ph) today. (applause)
