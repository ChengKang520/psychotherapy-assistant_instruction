00:00:35
MELANIE BREWSTER I could not be more excited to introduce our next speaker at the roundtable, Dr. Bonnie Moradi who I've had the privilege of knowing for over a decade now. Uhm, she's my mentor, role model in our field, and one of the best people I've met in and out of the academia. She's also, unsurprisingly, has a very long list of accolades which I'm going to really awkwardly read to you now cuz it's quite long. So, uhm, Bonnie Moradi is professor of psychology and director of the Center for Women Studies and Gender Research at the University of Florida. Dr. Moradi's research focuses on perceived experiences of discrimination, objectification and internalize prejudice. This research examines the nature of these experiences, their implications for psychological functioning such as health and workplace outcomes and their intersections across minority statuses, for example, gender, ethnicity, race, and sexual orientation. This research has garnered funding from the NIH, the Palm Center and the American Psychological Foundation's Wayne F. Placek Award. Dr. Moradi is a recipient of national awards including the Association for Women in Psychology's Florence Denmark Distinguished Mentoring Award, the APA Committee on Women in Psychology's Emerging Leader Award, and Early Career Awards from the APA Society of Counseling Psychology and its Section for LGBT, uhm, Issues, and the Counseling Psychologist Major Consen-- Contribution Award for Research with LGBT People of Color. She's associate editor of Psychology of Women Quarterly and the Journal of Counseling Psychology. And, of course, there's more on this list, uhm, and I could say much more but I don't wanna embarrass her too much, so please welcome me in joining Bonnie Moradi. 

00:02:10
BONNIE MORADI Thank you, Melanie for that very gracious and generous introduction. I have to say that all of the professional recognitions and awards I had, the best award for me throughout my career has been the opportunity to work with outstanding graduate students. And I know many of you here today are graduate students so it's-- you're privileged to be able to talk with you a little bit about my research. And I'm thinking particularly about intersectionality. 

00:02:40
(Re)Focusing Intersectionality: From Current Status to Origins and Promise Bonnie Moradi, PhD Professor University of Florida 

00:02:40
BONNIE MORADI The topic of my talk is Refocusing Intersectionality From Current Status to Origins and Promise. Ah, this title really reflects my own thinking and evolution on the topic of intersectionality. So part of what I'm gonna, uhm, ah, part of what I'm gonna do is critique my, my own research, up to this point related to intersectionality and then bring you back to what's the origin and principles of intersectionality were, where we might be both falling short, maybe wanting to move in the future. 

00:03:20
Intersectionality Translations in psychology Research Examples Origins and Promise 

00:03:25
BONNIE MORADI The, ah, landscape of the talk is going to be to discuss translations of intersectionality in psychology so far. To give you a couple of research examples from my work particularly with my mentors and graduate students, critiquing that work a little bit. Oops! Uhm, and then giving you an overview of the origins and promise of intersectionality is basically that. So many of you had heard of the concept of intersectionality in psychology. When you hear intersectionality, what do you think of? 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Intersection. 

00:04:05
BONNIE MORADI The inter-- yes. 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN The ways that different identities intercepting people's lives. 

00:04:10
BONNIE MORADI Yes. That's-- that perfectly captures how we think about intersectionality in psychology. We think about intersectionality as the ways in which people's different identities and experiences intersect. This is a very valuable focus, but I'm gonna argue that this is a really important part of intersectionality as well. So I'm not saying we should stop doing that. But I'm, I'm really arguing that we need to continue to do that. But we need to do more. 

00:04:40
Intersectionality and Research in Psychology Gender: As Intersectionality Perspective Centralizing the Experience of LGB People of Color in Psychology Approaches to Research and Intersectionality: Perspectives on Gender, LGBT, and Racial Ethnic Identities 

00:04:45
BONNIE MORADI Uhm, intersectionality in psychology has a long history particularly in, uhm, the psychology of women literature. Uhm, but more recently, intersectionality is getting broader attention within psychology. So we're-- particularly in 2008, there was an American psychologist article, Elizabeth Cole, that talked about integrating intersectionality and research. Uhm, at the same time, there was this special issue of sex roles, ah, edited by Stephanie Shields, ah, dedicated to, ah, intersectionality and new research. Uhm, little bit after that, there was a major contribution issue of the counseling psychologists dedicated to the intersections of, ah, race and LGBT, ah, identities or LGB people of color. And, and, and more recently, a second special issue of sex roles dedicated to the intersections of ra-- race, gender and sexual orientation. So there's one I look growing attention to, uhm, ways in which we can translate intersectionality into research turning to our big professional guidelines for practicing, ah, research as well. There's growing attention to the need to at-- to precisely what you said, multiple identities and multiple experiences when we work with people both in terms of, uhm, therapists, social advocates, as well as researchers. 

00:06:20
Guidelines for Psychological Practice Delivery Systems Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Girls and Women Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Clients 

00:06:20
BONNIE MORADI So for demo, the guidelines for psychological practice in the healthy delivery, the guidelines on multicultural adaptation, the guidelines for psychological practice with women and girls, psychological practice with older adults, uhm, and many, ah, guidelines for psychological practice with LGBT populations. Many of these guidelines, ah, ah, explicitly talk about exactly what you mentioned, the need to pay attention to multiple identities and the intersections of these identities in people's lives. 

00:06:55
Intersectionality Translations in psychology • Within group diversity • Multiple identities • Multiple experiences of discrimination RACISM CLASSISM SEXISM COLONIALISM HETEROSEXUAL ABLEISM 4th Annual CRS Symposium INSTERSECTIONALITY 

00:06:55
BONNIE MORADI So, what these different articulations share is, uhm, thinking about intersectionality to attention to within group differences. So, for example, when we're talking about women and girls, when we're talking about one type of women and girls, we're talking about a variety of women and girls from different backgrounds. In addition to within group differences, these documents talk about intersectionality as the idea of acknowledging multiple identities and acknowledging multiple experiences of oppression. Typically, it focuses on multiple experiences of oppression rather than the intersection of oppression and privilege for example. So, ah, how have we translated some of these guidelines and suggestions about intersectionality to actual empirical research? And here's where I'm gonna focus on my own research with my colleagues and students. Because I think if you critique a body of research, you better start with your own. 

00:08:00
Intersectionality in People's Experiences Research Example Every-day Discrimination Health & Psychosocial Functioning 

00:08:00
BONNIE MORADI So, what I tell you a little bit-- and I tell you a little bit on my research tio give you some background. So my research focuses on everyday experiences of discrimination, uhm, a very similar to that concept of micro aggressions, the association with and psychosocial functioning. So, we looked at these relationships. Uhm, for example, with psychological distress, with psychological well-being, within body image, and then eating problems, uhm, uhm, with a, a quondam use self-efficacy and with workplace outcomes. So another important thing about my research is that I focuses on perceived experiences of discrimination and their link to various problems. 

00:08:50
Perceived Discrimination Event → Perception → Outcomes Daily hassles and stressful ⇔ health • (e.g. Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974: Kanner, Coyne, Schaeler, & Lazarus, 1981 Perceived racist, sexist, heterosexist discrimination as chronic stress ⇔ health • (e.g. Clark, Anderson, Clark, & Willimas, 1999, Landrine and Klonoff, 1996: Meyer, 2003) • Micro aggressions (Sue et al, 2007) • Diary studies (Swin et al, 1998, 2001, 2003) Target's perspective 

00:08:50
BONNIE MORADI So when you think about discrimination experiences, there sort of a change of events, right? You have the events. You have what sense the person makes of the events, so how they perceive that event. And then, you have outcomes associated with our perception. My research doesn't focus on this. So, how our events actually perceived and what it needs to an event, uhm, being perceived as discrimination versus something else. For example, there's a lot of actually very good research in that area. That's not what I do. What I do is focus on this. So, once people perceive something as discrimination, what are some of those psychosocial core that are consequences of these perceptions? So this research is grounded in a larger body of research that's addressed at daily hassles and stressful life experiences I related to health outcomes. So, wide, wide, uhm, body of research that supports this practice. So building on that research a number of scholars have, ah, have argued that daily experience are-- daily experiences of discrimination or micro aggressions like perceived sexism, perceived racism, perceived, heterosexism, ah, are chronic, chronic stressors, therefore related to health outcomes. I mean, importantly, there's also a daily diary studies that support their perspective relationships between perceived discrimination of various kinds and that's the mental for-- indicators for example. So, uhm, people are keeping track of this in which they experience these daily occurrences over to a week period, for example, and there was experience over 2-week period being related to a health-related outcomes at the end of that 2-week period. So, the important thing here is that my research focuses on the target's perspective. So I'm not asking questions about whether these events really discrimination or not discrimination and-- or what those into that. But really my focus on the target's perspective and the psychosocial consequences are really perceptions. So my research and many other scholars' research has, uhm, developed in this area, in this sort of population specific pipelines largely, mostly other scholars research probably. 

00:11:25
African American Latina/o American Women LGBT Racist discrim Racist discrim Sexist discrim Heterosexist discrim Meta-analysis, r = .20 [CI: -.22 to -.17 (Pascoe & Smart Richanan, 2--9) 

00:11:25
BONNIE MORADI Uhm, so, for example, lots of people focused specifically on examining, examining African American people's experiences of racism, Latina-- Latino and Latina American people's experiences of racism, women's experiences of sexism, uhm, LGBT people's experiences of heterosexism. And, uhm, the reason that I know is of this entire body of research across populations and forms of discrimination demon-- demonstrated at least daily experiences of discrimination of it a significant relationship with mental health. So the effects is without is a negative .2 which is a reasonable effect size in correlation, uhm, with which. 

00:12:10
Discrimination & Mental Health: Examples from Our Team Discrimination Racism Sexism Heterosexism Sample of... African American women Arab American people Latina/o American people African American women Predominantly White women Women seeking counseling Bisexual people LGB Latina/o people r (p greater than 0.5) .28 .32 .45 .35 .43 .43 .16 .35 

00:12:10
BONNIE MORADI So, focusing more specifically on my own research with my colleagues and students, we've examined experiences of racism with, ah, with African American women, Arab American people, Latina and Latino American people. Uhm, we've experienced-- ah, we've, ah, examined experiences of sexism with samples of a, a com-- is largely of White women. Ah, African American women, women went on seeking counseling. We've examined experiences of heterosexism with bisexual people as well as LGB, Latina and Latino, uhm, Latino American people. You can see, these are the effect sizes that we found across this study. Young others is a little bit larger than the effect size on the meta-analysis. The reason for that is, in these studies, we focus on psychological distress and meta-analysis included but with psychological well-being and the stress indicators and its conceptualization and mental health. And typically, the relationship between perceived discriminations and psychological distress was a little bit stronger than the relationship perceived discrimination and, and psychological well-being indicators. So, from an intersectionality perspective, this is a very good and helpful information. For an intersectionality perspective, it misses some important factors, right? Particularly, it misses the fact that people are going exist in our single research pipeline so that there isn't anybody who's just an African American person. There's nobody that's just a woman. There's nobody that just, ah, such, such a minority person. Uhm, minority statuses exist across dimensions like age, ability, status, gender, ethnicity, race, social orientation, socio-economic status and so on. And then not mutually exclusive so people experience multiple forms of minority status. 

00:14:20
Minority Status ES Minority status across sociodemographic markers Not mutually exclusive Sonia Sotomayor Marlee Matlin Irshad Manji George Takei 

00:14:20
BONNIE MORADI So here's an examples of people who might be familiar to you. So, we have Wanda Sykes who's an actor and comedian. She's a lesbian, Afro-American woman. Marlee Matlin who is a White woman, is a Oscar-winning actress. Sonia Sotomayor is one of our Supreme Court justices, a Latina woman. Oops! Uhm, I, I try-- I'm not a sports person but I try to integrate some diversity of backgrounds. And to my presentations are highly admise(ph)-- admired and the New York Knicks. That's why I love New York. Ah, he's, ah, African-American man with some Jewish ances-- ancestry. Uhm, Irshad Manji who is an author and an advocate Canadian, ah, lesbian woman of Pakistani descent which is Muslim. And George Takei, famous from Star Trek, who's an Asian American gay man. So, if we wanted to understand these people's experiences, which of those research pipelines would capture those experiences? None of them really. Why? Because what would we ask them about? Would we ask them about racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious discrimination? So, so while those pipelines are very valuable and give us important information, they are not sufficient for capturing the real texture of people's lives. 

00:16:00
How Have We Translated Intersectionality into Research? Intersectionality RACISM CLASSISM SEXISM COLONIALISM HETEROSEXUAL ABLEISM 4th Annual CRS Symposium INSTERSECTIONALITY Both/and perspective • Minority statuses • Additive and interactive processes • Minority groups • Status-specific distinctive experiences 

00:16:00
BONNIE MORADI So, going back to my own research and its limitations, how have we translated this attempted to better capture people's experiences empirically in our research endeavors. So we've tried to take a both/and perspective. By that, I mean, we try to conduct research where we pay attention to minorities statuses, by examining their addictive and interactive variations with various outcomes. We've also taken a minority group's perspective. I'd rather pay attention to constructs or experiences I might be particularly salient for specific groups. So I'm gonna give you a research example for each of these different perspectives. 

00:16:50
African American Women: Double/Multiple Jeopardy Additive Facial Discrimination Social Discrimination Mental Health Interactive • One form exacerbates other 

00:16:50
BONNIE MORADI So focusing on the additive and interactive perspective, uhm, there's, ah, ah, a long standing of body of scholarship for-- largely from Black feminist scholars that argues that African American women experience what they called double and multiple jeopardy. The idea i-- in that racism and sexism of additive, uhm, impact to African American women's lives. So we're thinking about mental health, for example, experiences of racism and experiences of sexism would have an additive variations to mental health and that they also have multi-- multiplicative or interactive effects such one form of discrimination exacerbates the effect of the other form of discrimination. So, it's sort of like a moderation effect. So, in my dissertation study way back one, my, ah, aim was to test some of these conceptual discussions empirically. 

00:17:55
Hypoteses African American Women • Additive • Racisr discrim + sexist discrim • Interactive • Racist discrim x sexist discrim • Distress 

00:17:55
BONNIE MORADI So, uhm, I wanted to test the hypothesis that African American women perceive experiences of race-- racism and sexism would have additive relations to psychological distress but they would also have interactive relations such that one discrimination with moderate or exacerbate the effect of other form of discrimination on psychological distress. And, as I mentioned, the focus here, the outcome here, mental health communicator was psychologically distress. 

00:18:25
Additive/Interactive Hypotheses Moradi & Subich, 2003 134 African American women • 18 to 72 years old (M = 28, SD = 13) • 64% students, 32% community members SURVEY SURVEY Psychological distress • Brief Symptoms Inventory (Derogatis, 1993) Discrimination • Schedule of Sexist (Konoff & Landrine, 1995) • Schedule of Racist Events (Landrine & Klonoff, 1996) 

00:18:30
BONNIE MORADI So, I gathered data from a hun-- about a hundred, 30 African American women, ah, sample that was diverse in age, included both students and community members. We use typical measures to assess the constructs of interest. So the brief symptoms and inventories and measures, psychological distress, the schedule of racist events, the schedule of sexist events to measure their respective experiences of discrimination. Uhm, and with regards to the results, the results were mixed in, ah, relation to the hypothesis. 

00:19:05
Additive 2 3 4 5 M SD Psychological Distress 1. GSI 28*** 29*** 35**** 29**** .69 .58 Racist Events 2. SRE-Recent 80**** 69**** 58**** 38.00 17.33 3. SRE-Lifetime 60**** 69**** 46.07 18.32 Sexist Events 4. SSE-Recent 70**** 39.04 14.01 5. SSE-Lifetime 47.47 15.23 Note: ***p greater than 001. ****p greater than 0001. SRE - Schedule of Racist Events SSE - Schedule of Sexist Events 

00:19:05
BONNIE MORADI So, one thing that I want you to notice is I consist with an additive perspective. Each of the forms of discrimination were associated with greater psychological distress so both racist expanses of racism and a perceived experiences of sexist and most correlated positively was psychological distress. And I'm gonna-- and I want you to notice in this correlation matrix is that these very high correlations. So there's a correlation between perceived experiences of racism and perceived experiences of sexism, so we'll count it after that within a second. 

00:19:45
Additive/Interactive 

00:19:45
BONNIE MORADI So, further testing the additive and interactive hypotheses, ah, examined that the associations of these, ah, different experiences of, ah, discrimination and their interaction with psychological distress. What I found is that racism and sexism are accounted for largely overlapping variants in psychological distress that they did not account. They both did not account for unique variants, they accounted for overlapping variants with sexism cuz I'm assuming the variants accounted for racism and that the interaction approach was not significant. So, no support for the interactive hypothesis makes support for the additive hypothesis in that. Each type of discrimination was correlated with psychological distress. Ah, but, ah, that correlation was largely overlapping. 

00:20:40
Implications for Research & Practice Attend to discrum • Linked with distress Additive/Interactive • Mixed support • Overlap of racism/sexism • Ethgender (Johnson-Bailey & Cervero, 1996) • Gendered racism (Essed, 1991; St. Jean & Feagin, 1997) 

00:20:40
BONNIE MORADI So what do we take away from this study? First, that it's important to pay attention to African American women's perceived experiences of discrimination as they are associated with their psychological distress. That's important for both research and practice. Uhm, second, that there is mixed support for additive and neuro active hypotheses. But there are evidence suggesting substantial overlap between perceived experiences of racism and perceived experiences of sexism and their relations to psychological distress. So, the reports overlap with each other, and the, the clients accounted for in distress overlaps largely. And that's actually consistent of conceptualizations of constructs like, ah, ethnic gender and gender racism which suggest that African American women experience race and gender, and racism, and sexism to some extent together. So they might experience discrimination because they are African American women. And this notion of teasing apart, what is racism and what is sexism is not our ways of the sensible question to ask African American women to do. I think our, our qualitative studies are suggesting that when researchers probe and say, "Well, do you think this happen to you because there was racism?" Or, "Do you think this happen to you because there was sexism?" Af-- many African American respond-- women responders say, "That question doesn't even gonna make sense to me." That's an art to say that there are in a situations where you can clearly say that was racism and that was sexism. But that there's a substantial range of experiences where that distinction may just not be a very sensible distinction that researchers probe. 

00:22:35
Group-Specific Constructs RACISM CLASSISM SEXISM COLONIALISM HETEROSEXUAL ABLEISM 4th Annual CRS Symposium INSTERSECTIONALITY 

00:22:35
BONNIE MORADI So that was an example of where we look. We try to translate intersectionality as additive and interactive relations. Let me give you an example where we take a minority group's perspective and then tied it to a groups specific construct. 

00:22:50
Objectification Theory Sexual Objectifications Experiences Beauty Standards Body Surveillance Body Shame Disordered Eating 

00:22:55
BONNIE MORADI This study was grounded in objectification theory which poses that women's experiences of sexual objectification or things like being exposed to the sexual gaze, when hearing cat calls, uhm, being exposed to sexual harassments, they are routine expe-- unfortunately, routine experiences of objectifications that women experience all the time from kind of the daily manifestations to the more severe sexual harassments and even sexual assaults and rape. Now, these experiences, uhm, promote women to internalize cultural standards of beauty, for example, fitness. Uhm, and that this internalization in turn promotes women to engage habitual body monitoring so, as you're sitting here, for example, listening to me, a part of your consciousness might be attending to, is my shirt sitting straight, is my hair doing what it's supposed to do or sort of paying attention to how you look from an observer's perspective rather than experiencing your body from an internal subjective experience. So this habitual body monitoring in turn can promote experiences of body shame because the cultural standards of beauty is impossible to meet. So when you're constantly comparing yourself against those standards, you are bound to come up sort and that can promote body shame. And that, in turn, can up mental health consequences. They get increasing risk for eating disorders and a range of other psychological problems. So this was the theoretical foundation for this study. 

00:24:40
Empirical Support College women, mostly White, Heterosexual (Moradi, Dirks*, & Matteson*, 2005) Group-specific extensions Moradi & Rottenstein*, 2007 Wiseman* & Moradi, 2011 Parent* & Moradi, 2010 

00:24:40
BONNIE MORADI Uhm, the major kinds of objectification theory had been supported with college women, ah, samples typically comprised most of White heterosexual college women. Uhm, we've also extended downtime groups specific extensions of objectification theory. So, for example, in one study, we extended some and, and also found that, ah, marginalized deaf identities. So, that feeling of not quite fitting in with deaf culture or hearing culture was also associated with some of the body image constructs and objectification theory for that sample. And then other study was such on minority men. We've balanced for, for the chance of objectification theory and also found that internalized homophobia was associated with some other objectification theory constructs. And another study with, ah, sample of a largely heterosexual White men, we've found that tons of objectification theory was some carry out, we're supported in terms from men's drive for muscularity and, ah, steroid use. So lots of support for the basic kinds of this theory. 

00:25:55
Sexual Objectification & Muslim Women EVERYTHING COVERED BUT HER EYES. WHAT A CRUEL MALE-DOMINATED CULTURE ! NOTHING COVERED BUT HER EYES. WHAT A CRUEL MALE-DOMINATED CULTURE ! 

00:26:00
BONNIE MORADI In this particular study that I'm gonna talk about, we focused on Muslim women's experiences. In this cartoon captures the essence of what we were trying to get up. So, the one in the, in the bikini said, "Everything covered but her eyes. What a cruel male-dominated culture!" The woman in the hijab says, "Nothing covered but her eyes. What a cruel male-dominated culture!" So this captures a long slit standing squirrel debate, ah, about the role and meaning of the hijab in Muslim women's lives, with someone's colors arguing that it really epitomizes actual objectification and other colors actual reports on Muslim women suggesting that it may actually be a tour for freedom from sexual objectification. So we wanted to get out. How does when the hijab fit within this larger area of sexual, ah, sexual objectification theory? 

00:26:55
Hypothesized Model Hijab Social Objectification Experience Body Shame Disordered Eating Direct and Indirect relations Explore role of hijab Sexual Objectification & Muslilm Women Tolaymat* & Moradi, 2011 118 Muslim women • 17 to 60 years old • 47% born in U.S. • 37% Arab, 25% Pakistani ethnic background 

00:27:00
BONNIE MORADI So, our hypothesis or a test to direct and indirect relations, ah, propose in the model and to explore the role of the hijab within the context of the model. So, we gathered data with 180 Muslim women. We get perhaps to my graduates in (inaudible ), Atlanta who did all the legwork for the data collection. So, again, in Asia, there were sample, 27% of whom are born in the U.S., uhm, but over a third of the Arab descent, about a quarter of what, uhm, of Pakistani descent, and the rest were, uhm, other ethnic backgrounds. 

00:27:40
Hijab Index = Frequency x Conservativeness Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (Kozee et al, 2007) Attitudes Toward Appearance Questionnaire Internalization subscale (Heinberg, et al, 1995) Objectified Body Consciousness Scale Body Surveillance & Body Shame subscales (McKinlet & Hyde, 1996) Eating Attitudes Test-26 (Garner et al, 1982) 

00:27:45
BONNIE MORADI We, ah, use typical measures to measure the constructs of interest. We developed a measure of the hijab that captured both the frequency with which Muslim women chose to wear the hijabs, so from never wearing it to wearing it all of the time, as well as the conservativeness of the hijabs. So, from a very loose head scarf with lots of hair showing to a full-- per column. And we have pictures kind of capturing the gradation. 

00:28:10
Primary Analyses Path analysis of hypothesized model Hijab Sexual Objectifications Experiences Beauty Standards Body Surveillance Body Shame Disordered Eating • Indirect effects: • Bootstrap procedures with bias-corrected 95% Cls 

00:28:15
BONNIE MORADI So, our analysis-- our major analysis where a path analysis to test the direct and indirect effects with bootstrap procedures. So the path model shows basically that we found support for most of the hypotheses, the grounded and objectification theory. So, as you can see, such objectification experiences were related to greater internalization of cultural standards of beauty which in turn were related to a kind of body shame and eating disorder symptoms. One caveat was at the overlap between internalization and body surveillance was pretty large in our sample such that internalization really subsumed the role of body surveillance. So that's an area for further exploration particularly with Muslim woman and possibly other populations. And, as you can see, we found that the hijab, wearing-- oops-- wearing the hijabs was associated negatively with sexual objectification experiences. So the more frequent and conservative wearing of the hijab was associated with last reporting or sexual objectification experiences. And we found the support for most of the indirect relations hypothesized and objectification theory. So such an objectification experience and this were really related indirectly to body surveillance through internalization, to body shame, through internalization and, ah, and to eating disorders through internalization. And then hijab, it didn't have a direct relationships with these other variables. But it did have small relationships, that small indirect relationships with the variables through the role of sexual objectification experiences. So what does that mean? 

00:30:00
Implications for Research & Practice Extend OT to Muslim women • Internalization & surveillance overlap Specific experiences ⇔ specific symptoms • Sexual objectification ⇔ body image Hijab ⇔ interpersonal, not intrapersonal objectification • Caveat: choice 

00:30:00
BONNIE MORADI It means that we can extend some of the major tenets of object, object-- objectification theory to Muslim women. Internalization and surveillance may overlap substantially and this is something we can-- we, we worked with them. It's addressed that specific experiences of discrimination, in this case, sexual objectification experiences are specific form of sexism maybe important to pay attention to in rela-- in relation to specific types of psychosocial outcomes, in this case, body image and eating disorders. Uhm, and at the hijab-- wearing the hijab is related to lower immature personal objectification that are not necessarily directly to intrapersonal objectification. So lower reporting of objectification experiences but not internalization of those, ah, experiences. One really important caveat-- this was obviously a sample of a Muslim woman living in the U.S. where wearing the hijab is not legally or culturally mandated or forced. So the women in our study were largely practicing choice in wearing the hijab, so the result of our study should not be generalized or interpreted, ah, to support mandated wearing or nor wearing of the hijab in the U.S. or in any other, ah, cultures. And that's really important, uhm, because not only ou-- obviously, I think people know there are country where women are required to wear the hijab, but there are also women where women are required not to wear the hijab in certain contact. So I really wanna emphasize the choice is an important piece of the puzzle both in, ah, understanding the results of our study and kind of making tons of what it all means. 

00:32:00
Take Home Messages for Research & Practice Discrimination Specific experiences ⇔ specific symptoms Intersectionality • Additive/Interactive? • Overlap • Group specific constructs 

00:32:00
BONNIE MORADI So brought take home messages, discrimination experiences are related to psychological distress. Specific types of discrimination experiences like sexual objectification and implications for specific type of mental health outcome. And with regard to intersectionality, there's a mix of part for additive and interactive hypothesis. There's evidence that suggests substantial overlap between different forms of discrimination and that it's important to pay, pay attention to group specific constructs. In the examples that I gave the wearing of hijab in relation to a, a general theory that you think about. So that gives you a sense of how my research has dealt with intersectionality which I think is also reflective of how other psychologists have dealt with intersectionality, at least some other psychologists.

What us Left Out of this Frame? Origins 

00:33:00
BONNIE MORADI So the question I wanna ask is, what is a left out? What this is frame? What is left-- this is good, a valuable information for research and practice. It enhances our work beyond of thinking about single pipelines and single identities. But what are we missing? Where do we need to go. 

00:33:15
Intersectionality Origins Critique of categorical political activism Focus on systems of privileged & oppression 

00:33:20
BONNIE MORADI So, I think what it left out of this frame is the roots of intersectionality in, in Black Feminist Thought and Black feminist activism. So people like Sojourner Truth, Kimberlé Crenshaw and Patricia Hill Collins, who talked about the concept of intersectionality and coined the concept of intersectionality really originally as a critique of categorical political activism. I'll talk a little bit more about this. And so, so they have two major focuses, critique of categorical, ah, political activism, and a focus on systems of privilege and oppression. 

00:34:10
Political/Social Justice Activism Sojourner Truth (1851) - Akron, OH women's rights convention • Ain't I a woman? • Who is at the center of analysis in anti-sexist activism? • Black women's experience of slavery, racism, poverty, integral to women's rights movement bell hooks Angela Davis Audre Lorde Combahee River Collective and more If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down, these women together ought to be able to turn it right again. -Sojourner Truth 

00:34:10
BONNIE MORADI So Sojourner Truth famously in 19-- oh, 1851, uhm, in Akron, Ohio in a women's rights movement, uhm, convention asked the question, "Ain't I a woman?" So this very basic but profound question has been translated later to this scholarly notion of, "Who is at the center of analysis in political activism?" She was specifically speaking to women's rights advocates and saying, "Who is at the center of analysis in the women's rights movement?" And she was arguing that Black women's experiences of slavery, racism, poverty-- these are integral to women's rights and women's rights activism. They're not something separate from or something you do in addition or you do later. That is women's experiences. So, since Sojourner choose very simple but profound question, many other scholars have echoed that sentiment. So people like Bell Hooks, Angela Davis, Audre Lorde, Combahee Ri-- River Collective and many more, Black women scholars, many of them are sexual minority women, have echoed that sentiment, that the diversity of oppressions and systems of oppressions that shape different women's lives need to be at the center of the women's rights movement and feminism. And feminists, feminists have been quite responsive to this critique. Some, ah-- there are feminist scholars for example that say that this concept of intersectionality is perhaps the single most important contribution, ah, that women studies and feminism can make to scholarship in activism 

00:36:15
Political/Social Justice Activism Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics Kimberle Crenshaw! Kimberle Crenshaw (1989) • Critique of feminist and anti-racist political movements "insistence the Black women's demands and needs be filtered through categorical analyses" of racism and sexism 

00:36:20
BONNIE MORADI So, later, Kimberlé Crenshaw was really the first person who acquainted her the term intersectionality. And she was coming from a legal perspective, so she's a legal scholar. And she was critiquing feminists and anti-racist polic-- poli-- political movements for their insistence that Black women's demands and needs be filtered through categorical analyses of racism and sexism. So, what she argued is, Black women experience forms of racism like Black men. Black women experience some forms of sexism and the like White women do. But Black women also experience forms of oppression, discrimination, because they are Black women. And if we have movent-- movements focused on racism and movements focused on sexism, we missed the experiences of Black women. And so, that was her critique of that insistent that we have anti-racism movements and anti-sexism movements really leaves out the experiences of Black women and many other kinds of people. 

00:37:30
Political/Social Justice Activism Patricia Hill Collins (1990) • Oppressions are mutually dependent and shape each other in a matrix of domination • Oppression and privilege are structural BLACK FEMINIST THOUGHT Patricia Hill Collins 

00:37:30
BONNIE MORADI So, around the same time, Patricia Hill Collins wrote a very influential book, "Black Feminist Thought", ah, made of the same arguments that, that Crenshaw made. And Patricia Hill Collins specifically really underscored that "oppressions are mutually dependent in one another and they shape-- and are shape by one another" and that "oppression and privilege are systematic and structural." So she talked about a matrix of domination in which different forms of oppression and privilege along their lines or race, gender, class, sexual orientation, shape and are shaped by each other, so you can't separate them from each other. Uhm, so when I-- I think it was kinda difficult concept to wrap your head on. The one, one example is if you think about international sex trafficking, for example, here's a system in which sexism, racism, capitalism, globalization, these different systemic forces come together to position different groups of people as consumers, objects, ah, products in relation to one another. So systems of privilege and oppression work together. They're shaped and are shaped by one another, ah, and, and they're really systems. They're structures. 

00:39:10
Intersectionality Promise: Crenshaw (1991) Identity groups in which we find ourselves are in fact coalitions, or at least potential coalitions waiting to be formed... The most one could expect is that we will dare to speak against internal exclusions and marginalization, that we might call attention to how identity of "the group" has been centered on the intersectional identities of a few. ..Through an awareness of intersectionality, we can better among us and negotiate the means by which these differences will find expression in constructing group politics 

00:39:15
BONNIE MORADI So I'm gonna read to you this very long quote because I think it really captures both the origins of intersectionality and promise of intersectionality. So this is a quote by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1991. She wrote, "Identity groups in which we find ourselves are in fact coalitions, or at least potential coalitions waiting to be formed. The most one could expect is that we will dare to speak against internal exclusions and marginalization, that we might call attention to how identity of "the group" has been centered on the intersectional identities of a few. Through an awareness of intersectionality, we can better among us and negotiate the means by which these differences will find expression in constructing group politics." So I wanna go back and focus on the yellow parts. "Identity groups are in fact coalitions." I'll talk about what that mean but I just want you to absorb that sentiment. "Identity groups are in fact coalitions." "That we should call attention to how identity of "the group" has been centered on the intersectional identities of a few." And "Through an awareness of intersectionality, we can construct group politics." So, what does that mean? 

00:40:45
Political Intersectionality Cole (2008) Intersectionality as tool for recognizing... • There are no single identity groups • These are already coalitions • Structural systems of oppression & privilege create shared concerns and experiences • Coalitions waiting to be made to change systems Intersectionality as coalition building for political activism 

00:40:45
BONNIE MORADI She's arguing that intersectionality can be a tool for recognizing that there are no single identity groups. These are already coalitions. So I'm gonna talk about anti-sexism or feminism. That's already a coalition. It's a coalition of women of color, poor women, heterosexual women, sexual minority women, White women, it's already a coalition. When we talk about anti-racism, it's already a coalition. When we talk about immigration, it's already a coalition. These are not-- there's no such thing as a single identity group. That structural systems of, of oppression and privilege create shared experiences and concerns of cross groups. So this echoes Patricia Hill Collins' perspective, that you can't really separate these forms of oppression. If you understand racism, it has something to do with sexism. It has something to do with heterosexism, that these things exist in a matrix of domination, in which together, they shape people's mind. And that there are many coalitions waiting to be made. If our existing identity group politics are already coalitions, that signals to us that there are many more coalitions waiting to be made. And intersectionality is really a tool for coalition building for political activism which is very consistent with the theme of this conference. 

00:42:25
Intersectionality Promise RACISM CLASSISM SEXISM COLONIALISM HETEROSEXUAL ABLEISM 4th Annual CRS Symposium INSTERSECTIONALITY Beyond multiple identities & experience to (re)focusing on systems of oppression/privilege and building coalitions for political activism 

00:42:25
BONNIE MORADI So, what I'm arguing for and I'm hoping for is in psychology, we continue to do the good work that we're doing on within group diversity and multiple diversities and multiple experiences of oppression. But there was a move beyond focusing only on multiple identities and experiences to going back and refocusing on systems of oppression and privilege and building coalitions and formed by intersectionality for political activism. So with that, I think I'm probably okay on time. I thank you all for being here and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. 

00:43:15
[sil.] 

00:43:20
BONNIE MORADI One of the things that we tend to do and we have done historically is scrutinize oppressed identities and experiences of oppression and not ask parallel questions when it comes to privilege. So the, the question about-- one really good example of this, for example, uhm-- one really good example of this is questions we asked about identity conflict. These questions tend to be about the conflict between racial identity and sexual orientation identity. You asked, ah, sexual minority people of color a lot about how does your racial identity conflict with your sexual orientation identity or religious identity and sexual orientation identity? How does your religious identity conflict with you sexual orientation identity. I think, I think that would be people of color of a particular-- particularly good example of this. Uhm, yes, people's responses as I did it to African American women responses of that question, "It doesn't make sense to me" are similar in that context. Like, what do you mean and the-- I mean, there are certainly, at some experiences where people go and articulate. You know, I experienced homophobia in my family. I experienced homophobia in my church. When, when that the ca-- the topic of conversation is LGB people of color, we invoke race and racial culture in understanding that. When we talk about homophobia in White families, homophobia in White churches, we don't necessarily say, "How does your White culture conflict with your sexual orientation. You don't ask that question. I don't know of a single study that asks, "Can you talk about how your White identity with your gay identity?" So, I think that an im-- that's an interesting puzzle. Why do we ask it here and why do we not ask it here? Perhaps, there is something to be learned by asking it here. Or, perhaps a fact that we don't ask it here should tell us something about how much sense it makes to ask it here? Or, at least, focus the analysis on race and culture here but not here. We just call it homophobia here. We call it-- it's a racially tinged homophobia here. So, I think one way in which we can do that is to scrutinized a, a privilege identity in parallel fashion or ask ourselves why aren't we doing that. And as the fact that we're not doing that, tell us something about how much sense it makes that we're doing it here. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN What do you think of measures of multiple oppressed identity? Silly-like measures, like, an ex-gendered discrimination measure. I think like the Bell's, Bell', uhm, people of color prejudice measure. Like-- is that a, a better way to start doing this work or... 

00:46:25
BONNIE MORADI Ah, you know, it's-- I think that measures that are grounded in a specific population experiences get a little bit closer to what that population experiences might be like because they've kind of come out of what this discrimination look like for you. But again, that-- there's attention between that and getting-- I mean, those are still sounds specific intersec-- intersections, right? So, a measure that captures LGB people of color's experiences. It might capture that particular intersection but does it captures a-- the intersection of class or gender. So there's always gonna be something left out of the frame. And I think, as researchers, when we do, we build bodies of work. And those thing-- those study can get everything. So I think the goal is to keep moving, uhm, and also to understand that quantitative surveys don't get the whole picture that there's other pieces of the puzzle that scholars from different disciplinary backgrounds might be capturing and it's upon us. It's our responsibility not to get stuck into our own little pipeline of scholarship and really look broadly. What do sociologists have to say about this topic? What do, ah, historians have to say about this topic? What, you know, what other ways of understanding epistemologists have to say about this topic? So, yes, leaving those measures do, do something a little bit differently and maybe better but they're not about their, their own limitations. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Do you ever asked people what's the predominant-- the perception of their most predominant identity? And then, you know, start going out from there, uhm, what's the second most, third most. 

00:48:35
BONNIE MORADI Yeah. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN Ah, I don't know if that would makes sense. Because I think that if, if you ask someone and he think that there are more predominant identity is-- around their race and their gender is a lot, their perceptions of racism might be greater than their perceptions - 

00:48:50
BONNIE MORADI Yeah. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN - of sexism because they might attribute what's happening them to race. When it might be gender? Does that make sense? 

00:48:55
BONNIE MORADI Yeah. I mean, that's a really interesting question and I've never done that. I've never asked people to kinda rank their identities. There are other researchers who have done that. And I think-- you know, some people are able to do it and some people say I-- that doesn't make sense to me. So, so I haven't done it. But-- so the short answer is I haven't done it. Other people have done it. Respondents, reactions are mixed. But some people having a really negative reaction say-- saying, "Why are you asking me to separate who I am and rank order who I am?" Yeah. Oh, the, the other thought that I had is, is you can elude it to help people perceive events like what are the events. They might perceive it as racism but it might really be about gender. I think that's a really interesting and tricky question because s-- how do you know what it was really about? I mean, discrimination happens in interaction so the person's perception is a big part of that. And, you know, might-- some people argue. The perpetrator's intention is a big part of that. But we know there are many very harmful but unintended, ah, manifestations of discriminations or intentions, doesn't it? Ah, so how would parse out-- you perceive this as a racism but I think it was really sexism. It would have to be the researcher's judgment so you're just replacing one perception with another perception. And for me, I'm much more comfortable sticking with the particip-- the respondent's perception. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN In some of the studies we see like substantial overlap between, uhm, you know, experiences of sexism and experiences of racism, how much of that do you think is because of, uhm, like a method artifact that some of the measures we use are basically the same-- were asking the same questions but the frame of reference is different. 

00:51:10
BONNIE MORADI I think that's a part of it and I think that's all of it. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:51:10
BONNIE MORADI Because study-- in which non-parallel measures are used to assess different experiences - 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:51:20
BONNIE MORADI - also show positive correlations, maybe not as strong as the .69, but still positive correlations. So I think some of it is methodological but I think all of it is methodological. And coupled with people as qualitative reports of their - 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:51:35
BONNIE MORADI - experiences, I think there's a strong evidence that suggest that there is substantive meaning behind the overlap in these kinds of experiences that we try to separate. And I just wanna kind of re- emphasize my critique is not about separate examining of experiences versus together examining of experiences. It's really that there's a layer of intersectionality that's not about the person-- they have intersection on the theory that's not about the person or the person's identities or experiences but it's about systems and how understanding those systems is a tool for political activism and coalition building. So, this is good, We can keep doing this. But this is not all of intersectionality. To really realize the promise of intersectionally, we need to ask different questions about systems and how people can use shared experiences of these systems to do coalition building for political activism and recognizing the political activism that we do already is already a coalition building. It's not a single identity activism. That single identity activism is comprised of coalitions. 

00:53:05
UNKNOWN Uhm, maybe this is kind of feed backing of, of what you just shared. But in addition to thinking about intersectionality and where we can go, uhm, some authors have talked about it in terms of, "Let's get it, let's, let's move to advocacy, let's move to coalition building. And others have also talked about this idea that, that really take intersectionality where, where-- to, to fully realize its potential is to start to think about intersectionality as theory. So, intersectionality is something that can predict things. Intersectionality is, is moving beyond kind of identities and, and explanation to theory. And I wonder what are your thoughts on that? How do we get to a place where intersectionality becomes a, a theoretical i-- like a theory that begins to predict. And, in addition to explain, does that make sense? 

00:53:50
BONNIE MORADI Yeah. I mean, I think already these are the examples-- I think already what we're doing is, to some extent, that-- so when you're using intersectionality to articulate theory about additive and interactive hypothesis, when you're using intersectionality to articulate theory about good specific constructs roles in various outcomes, using intersectionality to predict things like identity conflict or not. So I think intersectionality is already being used. I think would formulate a hypothesis that comes out of intersectionality. We're using intersectionality as a theory. I think we have gone enough in psychology. There are some really interesting work in sociology but not in psychology to capture the aspects of intersectionality and translate intersectionality into theory that can formulate hypothesis of our systems, structures, and coalitions. So I would say that we can do more of them. 

00:55:00
UNKNOWN Uhm, it's-- so you, ah, you were using-- you mentioned Bell Hooks briefly, uhm, to, ah, to, to-- as an example of, uhm, someone who's been talking about intersectionality for quite some time and I happened-- I know that Bell Hooks often describes, like, the system that creates oppression within our society as a White supremacist, ah, patriarchy, uhm, which, ah, I think, you know, basically says that, uhm, there are, ah-- it's, it's a racist, sexist, et cetera system, right? Uhm, but we have other words like a kyriarchy and things like that really help highlight the fact that there are multiple identities functioning all the time and multiple levels of oppression and privilege constantly. Yet we, like, still focus on, like, racism as a static thing and sexism as a static thing, and like, things, like, that. So I'm curious if you have any thoughts as to, uhm, maybe why it's important to us to continue to talk in this like sort of discreet rooms but maybe also why we might not to be talking about a kyriarchy rather than a, ah, patriarchy. 

00:56:15
BONNIE MORADI Well, I think part of it is we need people like you to write about these other concepts and their applications ad psychology and counseling psychology so people will become more familiar. You mean, I think one of my pet peeves is, we all work in these little bubbles where we think we have these brilliant ideas and we just through of them. Well, in fact, there are other people who've had this brilliant idea for a while and I've been doing some really great work around it. Uhm, so I think that's part of the issue. We just-- we have our own language and our own measures. our own staff and we just kind of do that without really taking a broad interdisciplinary perception. I don't know if how many psychologists who'd read Bell Hooks or Patricia Hill Collins, or Kimberlé Crenshaw. So, part of it I think is people like you bringing these concepts to psychologists. Those people who teach psychologists taking care to take a broader perspective. Uhm, so, so I think you're, you're absolutely right. There's a lot to do there and this is not, ah, that sort of outside wall isn't gonna do it. It's people here who know the concepts to have to introduce it.
