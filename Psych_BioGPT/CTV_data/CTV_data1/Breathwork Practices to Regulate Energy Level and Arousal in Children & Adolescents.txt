JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Good afternoon, thank you so much for joining me. We are here today to talk about breath work practices to help our children and adolescents learn to regulate their own energy level and their own arousal level. But before we dive into the material let's just check in with ourselves. So find a way to be comfortable, wherever you are sitting it's fine, if it's a chair, on the floor or whatever works for you. And bring one hand to your heart and one hand to your belly. Get comfortable there, give yourself a little bit of pressure so you can really feel your hands connecting to your body. And then if it works for you close your eyes, if not just let your gaze rest on one spot out in front of you that isn't moving, and see if you can feel your breath moving in your body. You don't have to change your breath or do anything to it, just see if you can find it and if you can feel it. And just stay here for a few moments connecting with what our breath is doing right now in this moment, what's going on with your breath.

00:02:15
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Thank you. Okay, so energy level and arousal in children and adolescents. Now first of all we need to recognize that energy is a gift of childhood, right? Whenever we start talking about energetic arousal, I think most of us have somewhere in the back of our mind that we're trying to get our kids to calm down, right? That's what's coming up most of the time. Remember, energy is a gift. Now many of our children have it in abundance, right, and that is a great thing. Having a lot of energy allows our kids to stay healthy and engage with life. It gives them the opportunity to explore, to learn, to have fun, right, so energy is not a problem in and of itself, but for some young people having too much energy or not enough of it does become a problem that gets hard to manage, especially at school. Now the capacity to manage one's own energetic arousal level is an important skill that allows us to sort of energetically match the needs of the environment or the situation that we're in at any given moment. Some kids struggle with arousal levels that are higher or lower than what's optimal for their lives in general, and others have a hard time modulating between periods of higher energy a lower energy. For example, coming back down after participating in something exciting, like a sport or recess uh… or bringing their energy up when it needs to come up, like for example, moving from a period of quiet listening, reading reflection to a period of more active engagement with a person or with their class. Today we're gonna explore breath work practices uh… that support our own capacity to regulate our energetic experience. We're gonna look at the relationship between breath work and energetic arousal, and we're gonna learn some practices that can help the young people in our lives gain greater power over their own energetic state. So there is a direct and very powerful relationship between our breath and our nervous system, which is in large part responsible for our energetic arousal level including how reactive we are to external stimuli. Now we're gonna explore this a bit with an experiment. If you participated in this morning's webinar talking about working with children with ADHD, then you've done this experiment. But I'd like to invite you just for a few minutes, give it a try again, given what you already learned, just give it a try again and see if you can notice any new or different sensations the second time around. Okay, so in this experiment what I'm going to ask you to do is for 30 seconds breathe in and out only through your mouth. So get comfortable in your chair, close your eyes if that works for you, just whatever you've got going on, put it down. Close your eyes, and if it doesn't work for you to close your eyes just look at one thing that's not moving, and let your gaze rest on it. You also have the option to just look down. For 30 seconds breathe in and out through your mouth and notice what happens. Notice how you feel and in particular pay attention to any physical sensations or experiences that arise for you. So go ahead and start when you're ready, and you'll hear the sound of the singing bowl when the 30 seconds is up. 

00:05:45
[sil.] 

00:06:30
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So whatever just happened for you, whatever you felt, whatever you experienced, tuck it away in your memory, don't loose it. And for the next 30 seconds, breathe in and out only through you nose. So in and out, just through your nose, and your task is to notice what if anything changes, and what changes in your physical experience, emotional experience, mental experience, what's different? Go ahead and start, and you'll hear the sound of the singing bowl in 30 seconds. 

00:07:05
[sil.] 

00:08:10
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So what happened? What did it feel like when you are breathing through your mouth, and what if anything changed when you started breathing through your nose? Before I dive into what usually happens, I'd like to ask you to take the next minute. I'll just look at the clock for 60 seconds to write down what your experience was. So take some notes, reflect on your experience. What did it feel like for you when you were breathing through your mouth, and then what if anything changed when you started breathing through your nose? Go ahead and start now. 

00:08:45
[sil.] 

00:09:35
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Start to finish up with what you're writing. And let's talk about what happened. Now for most people the experience of breathing through their mouth is an uncomfortable one. The mouth gets dry, for many people they say their heart starts beating faster. When I ask people in a live audience "How do you feel right now after having breathe through your mouth?" Uh… They talk about muscle tension in the body, sometimes shoulders that are lifted, often a feeling of anxiety or umm… wishing that the time was over. Alright, for most people breathing in and out through the mouth is an uncomfortable, unpleasant experience. And for most people when they start breathing through their nose they feel better. And for most people when they switch from mouth breathing to nose breathing they feel better, that anxiety goes away, that heart rate starts to slow down. Often people say, "I didn't realize that I was having my shoulders up here and then when I started breathing through my nose they fell" and so that's what happens for most people. Let's talk about why this is so relevant for our kids, for our clients, for our students. Now what you just experienced in this experiment was the power of the relationship between our body, our breath and our nervous system. When you started breathing through your mouth you send out "Something's up, be ready, look alive" message to your brain, to your mind, and your body reacted accordingly by activating your sympathetic nervous system. Sometimes the sympathetic nervous system is also referred to as the fight-or-flight response. Now everyone participating here experience this a little bit differently based on a combination of your own personal biology, your previous life history and your skill set for managing threats, managing stress. And so everyone's experience is a little bit different but in general when we take that big inhale through the mouth, we're sending our mind a "Be ready, something's coming" message. Something important to recognize is that when the sympathetic nervous system engages it primarily does three things. One, it gets your body ready for action, and it gives you energy, it releases adrenaline into the blood stream, it tenses your muscles, increases your heart rate, your breathing rate, right. Two, it heightens your senses as your body, I mean as your mind scans for threats. So your body is getting ready for action, your mind is scanning for threats and it also amps up, what with my kids I call the protective brain, right. It amps up the protective part of your brain, engages it, activates it, so that you're able to respond to threats instinctually, more rapidly than your prefrontal cortex or thoughtful brain would be able to do. This is a very high state of arousal that is best activated when there is an actual threat, when there's an actual emergency. But often for many of our kids, they get stuck in this state of high arousal for a wide variety of reasons. Now what you also experienced is that when you started breathing through your nose, you send another powerful message to your brain, to your body. You send the message "Everything is okay here. Sympathetic nervous system, stand down. Thank you so much, call you when needed." And you allowed your parasympathetic nervous system to take back over. If you think about this, you know, if you have a hard time remembering which is which just think about if you were running away from a lion, would you be breathing through your mouth or your nose? Definitely your mouth, right? When there is a real threat, when you have to fight, when you have to run away, when you have to manage something scary, you breathe through your mouth in order to get as much oxygen in and out as quickly as possible. When you switch to breathing through your nose, you're telling your brain, you're telling your body, "Oh, things aren't as bad as we thought. Everything's safe here." The parasympathetic nervous system that you engage by breathing through your nose is often called the rest and digest mode. It governs our digestion, our healing, our growth, things that affect both our short and long term wellbeing. Whereas the sympathetic nervous system is really taking the short-term view, the parasympathetic nervous system is maintaining balance for the long-term. When the parasympathetic nervous system is in charge, we have full access to our prefrontal cortex to that thoughtful thinking part of the brain. We're capable of seeing the big picture of taking a long-term view, uh… absorbing new information, recalling information that we know, and our bodies can feel settled. Engaging this system, the parasympathetic nervous system, engaging it is sometimes called engaging the relaxation response. And as we just experienced, using our breath is one of the most powerful ways to do this. Now if you were only gonna share one breath work practice with your students and clients, a good place to start would be teaching them to check in throughout the day and say, "Am I breathing through my mouth or my nose?" And start to notice for themselves when they're breathing through their mouths, and then say,"Hmm, am I safe right now?" And if the answer is yes, try breathing through the nose instead. Switch to slow breathing through the nose, so that they can engage that parasympathetic and sue the sympathetic nervous system. That would be a really good place to start. We're gonna do lots more today but even if you just do that you'd be helping your kids. So an additional aspect of the breath nervous system relationship that we need to explore before we dive into the practices is the energy modulation that occurs in rhythm with our inhale and our exhale. Now each round of the breath has of course an inhale and an exhale. Every time we inhale, we raise our energy, right? So inhale means energy is going up. Every time we inhale, we raise our energy and that happens through an engagement of the sympathetic nervous system, but there's a wide range in how it happens. So this increase in energy can be big, it can be like a full system activation of our flight-or-fight response which is what often happens if we take a big fast inhale through the mouth, right. One of these… That's energy going way, way up telling us "Be alert, be ready." But we can also engage our energy, raise our energy as a uh… small subtle lift if we inhale slowly through our nose, right. When we inhale slowly through the nose, we activate that sympathetic nervous system just a bit, right. Just enough to give us a little energy but not enough to engage that kind of full threat of the fight-or-flight response. So each time we inhale we're bringing energy up. Now each time we exhale, we're calming. Each time we exhale, we're bringing our energy down. Every time we exhale we're engaging our parasympathetic nervous system and calming down our bodies. Now the longer you sustain your exhale, the longer you extend the exhale, the greater this calming effect is. So with every round of our breath we're bringing energy up, down, up, down. Sometimes a little and sometimes a lot, right. Umm… Practice is where the inhale is longer than the exhale or going to be energizing practices. So if you imagine over time, you inhale and bring energy up, exhale down, inhale up, exhale down, inhale up, exhale down. Over several rounds of the breath, the energy goes up, up, up, up, up. And conversely, when we focus on the exhale, when we extend the exhale, we're gonna bring energy up, and down, and up, and down, and up and down, and over several rounds of breath the cumulative effect is one of calming the nervous system. Now breath work practice is where your inhale and exhale are the same length, we're just coming up a little, down a little, up a little, down a little are considered neutralizing or balancing practices. Umm… As a side note, have you ever noticed uh… what most kids do if they're really upset and an adult says, "Take a deep breath" right? We say this to kids all the time, and it's relevant here often time kids are upset, they're crying or they're angry, and we want to help them calm their bodies down. What we do is we say "Take a deep breath." And then they do something like this. You guys seen that before? That it's really common, and it's a problem because we use language that's meant to help but then what it actually signals to kids is often take this big breath in through your mouth, and it actually increases their energy and engages their sympathetic nervous system which is of course the opposite of what we're trying to do. So just keep that in mind when your kids are upset, and you're trying to encourage them to pay attention to their breath, slow their breath down. What you really want is for them to focus on their exhale, for them to slow their breath down, not take the biggest breath in that they possibly can. Okay. So we're gonna practice activities today that can help us calm our bodies down, we're also gonna practice activities that can help us engage our power and our energy in a way that's grounded rather than frenetic, right. Often when we take those big breaths in, we can engage our energy, but it can quickly kind of spiral off into like a frenetic energy or an anxious energy. We're gonna explore calming practices, and we're gonna explore practices that are simultaneously energizing and grounding. First we're gonna explore practices that help us reduce our arousal level and calm our bodies. These are practices that primarily do this not only through engagement of the parasympathetic system but also through the stimulation of something called the vagus nerve. When we stimulate the vagus nerve we induce that relaxation response. Now the vagus nerve is sometimes called the wandering nerve, and it connects from the brain stem and then wanders down into our body, branching off and connecting with most of our major organs, and it also has a branch that extends into the muscles and nerves of the face and even the sinuses. So this is a very important nerve of communication between the body and the brain. And the vagus nerve is intimately connected to our threat response system and to our arousal level. Now a toned, healthy vagus nerve that's capable of quickly and efficiently carrying messages from the brain to the body, and the body to the brain allows us to more easily access our relaxation response and engage the relaxation response even when we were very, very highly aroused just moments prior. So we're gonna look at some activities that can both help us stimulate the vagus nerve in the moment and also that umm… help the vagus nerve stay healthy, that exercise and tone the vagus nerve over time. The first practice that we're gonna do is something called heart and belly breath, and it's an expansion of what we did right at the beginning of this seminar. So now as we move into the practice session of our time together, I'd encourage you to just put all your stuff down, right, minimize your own distractions and your space and really dive into experiencing these practices. I will try to repeat the practices after we do them together so that you can take some notes if you need to, and if questions arise later about the specifics of the practice you'll have my email address. So see if you can just really engage, and do the practices yourself as we're doing them rather than just taking a ton of notes. Okay, alright. So bring one hand to your heart and one hand to your belly, and right back to that position you were in when we started 20 minutes ago. Now we're gonna do several different stages or variations of this practice and then I'll talk you through them afterwards 'cause some are better for some ages of kids, and you can break them apart and put them back together in different ways. But we're gonna do them all together right now. So hand on your heart, hand on your belly. If it works for you to close your eyes, close your eyes. If not, just stare at one spot that's not moving. And first, just bring your attention to your breath. See if once again you can find your breath moving in your body. 

00:22:50
[sil.] 

00:23:00
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And now if you're not doing so already, start to breathe in and out through your nose, and slow your breath down just a bit. So you're taking a full breath in and a full breath out. 

00:23:20
[sil.] 

00:23:40
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now you can stay right here just taking a full breath in through your nose, then exhaling completely through your nose. Or optionally on each inhale, see if you can soften your belly and let it expand. So bring your breath all the way into your belly, let it soften and expand, and then as you exhale pull your belly button in and push all of the air out. So you are breathing into your belly and out of your belly. Just stay there for a few moments at your own pace. 

00:24:20
[sil.] 

00:24:50
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And now again you can stay right here doing this, just breathing into your belly and out of your belly or optionally, after you filled your belly with air, see if you can breathe in just a tiny bit more and fill the space behind your heart with air. So you are breathing into your belly, into your heart, out of your heart, out of your belly. Into your belly, into your heart, out of your heart, out of your belly, and keep going like that for a few more moments at your own pace. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:26:15
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER When you're ready bring your hands back down to your lap. Now open your eyes or look up. Okay. So heart and belly breath, so this is a practice in neutralizing our balancing practice where the inhale and the exhale are about the same length. And then we add the hands on the body, that little bit of proprioceptive input, that soothing to the vast majority of people to that balanced breath, and it takes the experience from being kind of a neutralizing one to one that for most people feels calming, soothing, even a bit protective. Now we did this in several stages, and I'm gonna talk you through it briefly. So you can write it down if you want. Now the very first thing I asked you to do was just bring your hands to your body, one to your heart, one to your belly and notice your breath. See if you could feel and find your breath moving in your body. Now you can do that with your kids, your students, your clients, your own kids. You can do just that piece of it several times, maybe even all the times. For example, if you're working with pre-school age kids, maybe that's all you do, if you're seeing them once a week, maybe you just do, "Can you find your breath? Can you feel your breath moving in your body?" But if you want to go onto the next stage, if you want to scaffold and add this next piece, uh… the next thing that I ask you to do was to start to breathe in and out through your nose, finding a steady even rhythm to your breath, where your inhale and exhale were about the same length. Now again, you could stay there just breathing in and out through your nose, finding that steady rhythm. If you want to keep going, right, either because your kids are older, and you think that they're ready for it or you've done that just to find a steady breath for several weeks with your kids. When you're ready to move forward the next step is fill your belly with air. Let your belly soften and expand as you inhale, and then pull your belly button in and push all the air out on the exhale. Now I find that with the kids I work with, I really have to use very specific language like, "Let your belly get bigger, let your belly soften, let it expand." Uh… Because the kids are holding in their stomachs, really like, young, like, five or six year-old kids are not wanting their bellies to get bigger. That's a very powerful, very strong cultural message they're receiving. I have to literally say to them, "The point is to let your belly get big." Okay. So breathe in and out from your belly, and then when you're ready to add the next step, if you're ready to add the next step, the language is, "After you fill your belly with air, see if you can breathe in just a tiny bit more and fill the space behind your heart with air, so you're breathing into your belly, into your heart, out of your heart, out of your belly." That's it, that's the practice. Now heart and belly breathing is one of those sort of foundational practices that I do a ton with my kids. I often actually incorporate this into the opening ritual of my work with my students, so it's something that we'll do every single time when we see each other. Right, I ring the singing bowl, and then we do heart and belly breath, and it just becomes part of their regular routine. And it's one of those practices that's a very simple one for kids to implement and integrate as part of an everyday home practice as well. Okay. So now we're gonna practice another breathing technique it's called a long in a breath. And this is a practice that extending the exhalation. I'm gonna grab a visual support for us that'll help uh… illustrate this. Alright. So this is something called a Hoberman sphere. We're gonna use it in a minute. Alright. Now if you need to move around a little, just do so. Alright, just move around a little bit to kind of reset for this next experience. Now a long in a breath is a practice of expanding the inhalation so we… sorry, extending the exhalation. So we inhale freely and then we exhale slow and long, and the idea is that each round of this breath is calming, is soothing, it's bringing our energy lower. Now we can do this in a variety of ways, but I find the simplest way to start, the easiest way to teach this to your kids is with the two four pattern and a count. So for example, counting inhale one, two, exhale one, two, three, four, inhale one, two, exhale one, two, three, four. Now a lot of kids benefit from some visual support. Younger kids benefit from it, I would say greatly. If you're working with pre-school age kids, I always give them some visual support if I can, uh… but there are lot of older kids for a wide variety of reasons are able to stay more connected to the pattern in a visual than through the counting. So there are a couple of ways to do this. One is just to simply use your hands, inhale one, two, exhale, one, two, three, four. Inhale one, two. Exhale one, two, three, four. If you want to add a little more kind of oomph to it, you can use this. It's called a Hoberman's sphere. So you can see it, it's just a ball made out of all these interlocking parts, but what's great about it is it gets really big and really small. So it tends to really capture their attention. Umm… Pre-school age kids just love the Hoberman sphere. I will warn you, that if you're using a Hoberman sphere for a specific practice with young kids it's a good idea to have let them see it and explore it a little bit in advance, otherwise they may all stop breathing to say, "Can I try it? Can I see it? Can I try it?" So in general, whenever I'm using a prop with my students, I try to give them a chance to see it, explore it, understand what it is before I ask them to do anything specific with it. So what this would look like, it's just inhale one, two. Exhale one, two, three, four. Inhale one, two. Exhale one, two, three, four. Okay, so why don't we try it together for a few movements? I'm gonna open and close the Hoberman sphere, just get comfortable, breath in and out through your mouth and see what it feels like to breath in this two four pattern. I mean, I'm sorry breath in and out through your nose and see what it feels like to breath in this two four pattern. Here we go. Inhale one, two. Exhale one, two, three, four. Inhale one, two. Exhale one, two, three, four. Inhale one, two. Exhale one, two, three, four. Inhale one, two. Exhale one, two, three, four. Inhale one, two. Exhale one, two, three, four. Inhale one, two. Exhale one, two, three, four. Okay, so just notice how you're feeling. Okay. Now a few more notes here. When kids are really struggling, say your kids are very highly aroused or they're having a lot of anxiety or they're very where they can physically pumped up about something, sometimes that's really hard to slowly exhale down. Right, we don't have a lot of control over our nose, the shape of our nose, and it can be very hard to really slow and extend that exhale. When that's happening kids can often benefit from a resistance breathing practice where they inhale through the nose and then exhale through pursed lips. So it just look like this, inhale, exhale. So they're literally just narrowing the airway, right? They're narrowing the space which forces the breath to slowdown. Sometimes you can use a practice like that where you inhale through the nose and exhale through pursed lips as a sort of transition to having the inhale and exhale both be through the nose. Right, that period of high anxiety, high energy can be stabilized with the resistance breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth. And then once things calm down a little bit, you can engage that long in a breathing in through the nose, and out through the nose. Another note about the long in a breath practice, the practice of extending the exhalation, uh… this is a very, very powerful practice for kids who experience anxiety, anxiety disorders, panic attacks and also for kids with asthma. Now those two things don't always go hand in hand, but sometimes they do. And this is a breathing practice that can really serve those kids, both of those kids. Now what often happens for kids when they are having a panic attack or an asthma attack, either of one is that their breath work pattern becomes one that's all about big inhales. Right, when the body is worried, it wants to get breath in. So if you've ever seen somebody having a panic attack or an asthma attack what you often see as them taking these big breaths in and then little short breaths out 'cause their body can't wait to get to the next inhale. So it starts to look like… right, these big, big breaths in and short breaths out. And what's actually happening in their lungs is that they're filling their lungs with air, and then they're just taking a short exhale. So they're not getting all of the air out. Right, they're filling their lungs up, there's a short exhalation, so there's like, oxygenate… deoxygenated air hanging out in the lungs taking up space. And now there is less room for the next breath to come in and then the exhale short again, and there is even less room in the inhale and exhale short again, and there's even less room because air is hanging out in the lungs taking up space. So they go through several rounds of this, and at some point they have to have an air dump. So you'll see this. And then the whole cycle starts all over. And of course, as they do that their energy and arousal levels getting higher, higher, higher, higher, higher and their anxiety, their panic is getting greater, and greater, and greater. When you've got kids in this situation what you want to help them do is focus on their exhalation. Right, the body is going to inhale naturally, but if you can get those kids to get all of that air out, really focus on the exhale then they're gonna spend more time in that calming, parasympathetic nervous system engaging state and also just physically, practically, they're gonna get all the air out so that they're capable of taking a full breath of oxygenated air in. Now this is one of those situations that's like umm… you can't teach someone to swim when they're drowning, right. You can't do this with kids who are having a panic attack or kids who have asthma and are kind of starting to come into an asthma attack, you can't do this with kids if they've never done it before. Right, it is not gonna make any sense, it's not gonna work. The kids have to have this as part of a regular practice. It has to be part of their routine, something they've learned, got uncomfortable with, done many times and once they have, once they've really practiced it, then if you catch a kid kind of on that upswing of anxiety or that upswing coming into an asthma attack, you can encourage them, ask them if they think that would help to focus on the exhale to make their exhale longer than their inhale and really give them something active and engaged to do, something empowering to do during an experience that usually feels very disempowering. Now all of that said, if your kids having an asthma attack give them their inhaler, go to the hospital, whatever it is that you need to do, but in the interim between a kid's anxiety or asthma starting to take control of their breath and getting the help that they need uh… this can be a very, very stabilizing force. So I'm gonna pause there for just a moment to check in and see if we have any questions. No, we're good. Okay. Uh… One last note before we move on to a neutralizing practice. Uh… In heart and belly breaths, sorry to move backwards, I just want to check in one thing. In heart and belly breath there is umm… there is something important that I'd like you to experience. So I'm gonna ask you to just try a quick experiment. Bring one hand to your heart and one hand to your belly, notice how it feels, and then switch from the opposite hand on top. Does it feel as good? Go ahead and switch back. Okay. Now for most people, one version of this feels really good, very soothing and the other version vaguely irritating and anxiety producing. And nobody really knows why, uh… but I say this because I've often observed people teaching yoga to children who say things like, "Put your right hand on your heart and left hand on your belly." And I urge you not to do that. Don't tell the kids which hand to put where, just say, "One hand on your heart, one hand on your belly." Because if you tell them, "Right hand on your heart, left hand on the belly or vice-versa" it's possible that like half of your kids will be uncomfortable. Okay, so just one hand on your heart, one hand on your belly. Sometimes you'll see them do a little… right, to decide which one feels better, but just let it be whatever when they want. Okay, thank you. So the next practice that we're gonna do together is called alternate nostril breathing. Now some of you may have done this before uh… if you've participated in yoga classes. This is the breath work practice that is probably the weirdest one I ever do with my kids. I always recommend that as a uh… teacher, as a counselor, if you're doing this with your kids you own the weirdness of it. You've got to own the weird. You have to say it's gonna look weird, you have to give them time to feel silly, to feel embarrassed and to get over it. What I often tell kids is that when you do something for the first time, right, anything, when you do something for the first time, what your feeling is not necessarily the thing itself, you're feeling the newness of it. So you have to do it enough to get over the newness before you can get to actually experiencing the thing itself. And the weirder something is, the more you have to get over experiencing the newness. So I tell kids that before I teach them alternate nostril breathing because I don't want them to jump right to, "I like this, I don't like this" before they've gotten a chance to get over the newness of it, to get over the strangeness of it. Okay. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna do the practice together, and we're gonna give you two different options for how to hold your hand. Now the basic gist of this practice is that you are using your thumb and then your ring finger to close off alternate sides of your nose, and you're inhaling through one side then exhaling through the other side, then inhaling through that same side and then exhaling through the other side. So the pattern looks like this, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Now that's different from a pattern where you would inhale one side, exhale the other side, inhale the other side, exhale the other side. Do you see that makes a circular pattern that feels very different energetically? What we want is inhale, exhale through the other side, then inhale that same side again and exhale through the other side. So you've got this nice kind of up and down the mountain pattern rather than the circular pattern. I'm gonna talk you through the whole thing but that's the gist. Okay. So here's the two hand choices, the first and the one that I generally prefer, you're gonna glue your first finger and your middle finger together, and then put them right in between your eyebrows, and give yourself a little bit of pressure there. Just like have a nice little stable resting point. And then now you have access to your thumb and your ring finger. Right, you can go back and forth. So just see what that feels like to you, just play with it a little bit. Okay. Now some people are driven completely nuts, having their hand in their eye sight like that, right? They feel claustrophobic, they feel uncomfortable, it's a distraction, it bothers them. If that's the case for you and for your kids, just take those two fingers and curl them into your palm and then come back and here you go, and nothing's in your eyesight. Now for me this feels a little bit floaty, a little untethered. You can help minimize that feeling by holding your elbow with the opposite hand. So go ahead and give that a try. Alright. Now chose your hand position. Give you a second. Hands up. Take a breath in, exhale completely. Now close your thumb, inhale, close your ring finger, open your thumb, exhale. Inhale, close your thumb, open your ring finger, exhale. Inhale, close your ring finger, open your thumb, exhale. Inhale, close, open, exhale. Inhale, close, open, exhale. Inhale, close, open, exhale. Inhale, close, open, exhale. Now keep going for a few more rounds at your own pace.

00:46:00
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And then when you're ready to be done just bring your hands down to your lap. Take a few clearing breaths. 

00:46:10
[sil.] 

00:46:15
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER That's alternate nostril breathing. So to repeat the pattern is inhale one side, exhale the other side, then inhale that same side and exhale the other side. Up and down, up and down. Now this is a neutralizing practice. Sometimes I talk to kids about this being like an energetic reset button. And I talk to them about this idea that like sometimes we don't even really know what we need. I ask the kids, you know, "Have you ever felt like you don't know if you need to bring your energy up or down or what you need but like, you and the world are just clearly in mismatch today?" Right, when I say that to kids they largely understand what I'm talking about. They've had this experience of like, "Me and the world, we are does not on the same page today, and I don't know what's going on." Right, you can think of a neutralizing practice like this, like alternate nostril breathing, almost like an energetic reset button, right. This can kind of bring us to a neutral place where, you know, I mean it give us everything we need but it gives us a little bit of stability, so we can maybe figure out what it is that we need. Alright, now the last thing I'll say about alternate nostril breathing uh… is this time of year when lots of kids have colds, it might not be a terrible idea to have some tissues around and have them pass them around, and let the kids blow their nose before they do this practice or even have tissues available for them as they're doing it. 'Cause if they have any congestion on one side or other. Uh… the good thing is that this practice can help clear it up but you're gonna want some tissues handy. Alright. So now let's explore how combining deliberate breath work with movement of our body can energize us, engaging our whole body in a way that maximizes our power in conjunction with the sense of stability and grounding rather than creating a frenetic or anxiety producing type of energy as we often see with sympathetic nervous system over activation. So the first of these energizing practice is that we're gonna do together is something called balloon breath. So again, put all your things down, you can be sitting on the ground, you can be sitting in a chair as we do this. But get comfortable, sit up tall, bring both hands to your knees, and we're gonna move our bodies with our breath. So first just inhale, and exhale and now start to move your body. Inhale roll your shoulders back and look up, exhale, round your back and look at your belly button. Then imagine, as you're inhaling that you get bigger like you're blowing up a balloon, and as you exhale, that you're letting the air out of that balloon. Sometimes young kids even enjoy and appreciate inhaling through the nose, and then on the exhale, going… 

00:49:20
[sil.] 

00:49:25
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And just do that a few more times at your own pace. Inhale, and the exhale with the round. And now let's make it a little bigger. So next time you inhale, bring your arms up and out, and then exhale and give yourself a hug. Blow up the biggest balloon that you can and then let every drop of your air out. 

00:49:55
[sil.] 

00:50:10
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And then we're gonna do the same thing in reverse. Next time you exhale, bring your hands to your knees, and then keep them there. Inhale and open your body with your hands down, exhale and round. Few more times. Let's slow down and keep your body still and take a few more breaths here with your body still. 

00:50:50
[sil.] 

00:50:55
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And then when you're ready, open your eyes and look up. Okay. That's balloon breath and that's probably the simplest of these combining breath with movement practices. So to repeat, all we did we'll sit with our hands on our knees, breathe in and out through our nose. First, we just took a few breaths without moving the body and then we started to combine and opening and closing of the body with the inhale and exhale. So we opened our body, rolled the shoulders back, lift the heart up, look up with the inhale, exhale, round the back and look at the belly button. And you can use the visual with your kids, especially your younger ones. Now imagining filling up a balloon and then letting all of the air out. The younger ones will really often enjoy making that… balloon letting go noise, but it does also serve a purpose which is that, it forces them to slow down the exhalation. And our young kids often has have less control over their breath than the older ones, so doing things with vocalization where they're forced to slow down can be a way to help them engage that relaxation aspect of the breath. All right. Then we took our arms big, and hug the body, and did that a few times and then you just go back to a still body in reverse. All right. So inhale and open, and then choose an exhale to bring you hands back to your knees. And then just do a few rounds and then come to steady, breathe in and out a few times and you're done. Any questions all, is there anything coming? Oh, we're good. Okay. So now we're gonna take it up a notch, we're gonna stand up and we're gonna start moving our body much more vigorously. So what I'm gonna suggest is that you clear little space for yourself. I'm gonna clear my space a little bit and give you a minute to just find a place to stand. You don't necessarily need a yoga mat, but you do need a little bit of space to move around. 

00:53:10
[sil.] 

00:53:30
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So this next practice is one of the favorite practices for many, many of the kids that I've worked with. And this is the practice that I often offer kids, if they need to feel like a super hero that day. When you got kids who are in a situation where they just… They've got a challenge coming up, they've got something hard to do, they really need to engage their power, they need to harness their energy, they really need to take ownership of their own body. This is a practice that can help do all of that while still keeping as a grounded, while still keeping them stable without creating this energy that feels like they're kind of floating of into the either. And it's called ‘Ha Kriya' So what I'm gonna ask you to do is separate your feet a little bit more than hip with apart. And you'll get maximum benefits from this experience if you actually participate with me. So separate your feet a little more than hip with apart and point your toes out just a bit and then bend your knees. And you're coming into it's called a goddess stands or a horse stands. And so bend your knees and first just see what that feels like. Just checking with your legs how are they feeling… I always ask the kids, "How long do you think, you could stay here for? All right. Some of them are like forever, but more of them are like, "Not very long." All right. I want them to stay here long enough to start to really feel it. And now we're gonna start to pull our power in. So what this looks like is, I mean, reach out in front of me my palms are facing down. I'm gonna take a breath in and then on the exhale I'm gonna make a loud vocalization pull my arms and make fists. It's gonna look like this. Ha, all right. Did you give it a try? Let's try. Ha, all right. Now here is the practice. I'm gonna do that eight times this way then I'm gonna bring my arms up and do the same thing eight times this way, then four, four, two, two, one, one. Don't worry about that pattern just yet. Just listen to my voice, I'm gonna yell, switch, when it's time to change direction. And then I'll go over the whole thing with you again one more time doing it. All right. So get a little bit lower, How are your leg doing? reach your arms out, big breath in, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha switch, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, switch, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, switch, Ha, Ha, Ha, switch, Ha, switch, Ha switch, switch, switch, switch. Straighten your legs one hand on your heart, one hand on your belly. How is your body doing? Check in with your legs, with your heart. 

00:56:50
[sil.] 

00:56:55
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And big your feet back together, and slowly come back down to sit. All right. So check in with how you're feeling now I know that for a lot of adults doing that practice is super empowering and maybe for an equal number of adults doing it makes them feel really silly. Now this is one of those practices that if it's gonna work, if it's gonna have any power with your kids, you need to own it. All right. You need to really embrace your own power otherwise the message that you're sending the kids like if you're doing this a little wishy-washy and kind of thing like you're embarrassed by it, the message you're sending them is, there is something to be embarrassed about here. If you're gonna help your kids own their power, you have got to own your power. All right. So really just a feel for this, practice it at home. I encourage you to do it because the kids love it. And who doesn't need a practice that can sometimes make them feel like a super hero. All right. So get over your own kind of discomfort with it, if you're having any practice it, and then get in front of your kids and just fully, fully invest yourself in using all of your power to do this activity. All right. So the pattern in what we did the practice is come into that horse stands or goddess stands. All right. So separate your feet a little more than hip with apart, toes turned out, and then bend your knees. Have them stay there long enough to really start feeling what's going on in their legs because what that gives you is an opportunity after you finish the activity to ask, "Hey, how you're legs doing?" And you know the crazy thing is when you ask that everyone is like, "Ha, they're fine." All right. They did not think that they can hang out there for so long but once you start pulling that power in, you don't feel what's going on in your legs at all. Your legs are fine, ones you start pulling that power in your legs feel powered up, they don't feel shaky, they don't feel like they can't do it. They can do it. All right. So give them a minute to really feel the engagement of the muscles in the legs. And then you reach your arms out palms facing down and then for… On the high you pull your hands in, turn your palms to face up and make fists so it likes this. And there is got to be some… to it right. Like it looks different, if you're just going like this, right? Versus. Okay. And then you bring your arms up, hands facing forward, and pull them in as you turn your fists to face your body so it looks like this. 

00:59:50
[sil.] 

00:59:55
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And the pattern is eight, eight, four, four, two, two, one, one, but don't get all concerned if you mess that up, it's really not the end of the world. The way you wanna guide it, if you're trying to do that pattern is by counting in your head. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, switch. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, switch. One, two, three, switch. One, two, three, switch. One switch, one switch, switch, switch. All right, that's the pattern. And then give them a minute have them straight in their legs, and check in with the heart, check in with the legs. Notice, how their body is doing, give them that moment and then you're done. All right. ‘Ha Kriya' any questions on that one? Still good. Okay. I'm gonna pause just for a minute in case anyone does have a question. Sometimes I get the question like, "How if you're in a school, can you do that without like all the other teachers hating you?" That's one you're gonna have to workout yourself. But what I can tell you I wouldn't recommend is doing this without the vocalization. So sometimes people think like, "Oh, you know, I don't need to do that loud vocalization, I can just do a big strong exhale." Anytime you think, "Oh, I wanna change a practice." For any reason whether it's because of your kid or the environment or whatever is going on. If you think, I'm gonna change this practice from what I learned because I think it can be better or different, or suit my circumstances. I would always say that's a great thing but make sure you do it yourself, before you do with the kids. Because sometimes changing a practice we don't always know exactly how it's gonna change the experience. Onetime somebody asked me this and I said, "You know, I don't know, I've never done it that way without the vocalization. Lets try, we're all grown ups here who can, you know, take care of ourselves let's give it a try, lets experiment. And we did it and we're mostly all really light-headed and dizzy maybe because doing that big strong exhalation with the moment, without the vocalization, it just had the effect, it had a different effect to change the breath we're practice enough that it made us light-headed and I said, "You know, I would never do this with kids, what about you guys?" And we pretty much all in the room agreed. So I would say, you got to do the vocalization, if you can't do it in the environment you're working in, what you gonna do? Do the best thing you can, you know, and if you can get the kids in a different environment, or check in with your neighbors, and see when might be a good time is probably worth in. All right. Any questions? We're good. All right. So the next practice that we're gonna explore together is something called breath of joy. Now breath of joy is another standing practice that coordinates breath work with movement so we're gonna get up. Now I'm gonna show you the way that I would normally get up with the kids. I've been getting up and down just regular but with kids I usually do something called no handstand to get up. Especially if I'm working with groups of kids. Now I'm not sure those of you on the webinar if you're mostly working with groups or one on one, but I've the experience many times, working with groups of kids, where I've said something like, "Okay, everybody stand-up." And somehow what they magically here is stand-up, run around, push somebody, and talk, right? Have you ever had that experience? I know, I've had it more than once. So what I try to do is managed guided transitions so I'm really taking them through a transition from sitting to standing, that ends with us all being in the same place together. So I don't get that stand-up, run around, talk, push somebody phenomena going on. All right. So what I do is, I bring my feet to the floor just wakeup the feet a little bit, reach your arms out in front of you. And then you have an option I'm just gonna come up to stand but you could always rock and roll here for your no hand stand. I've got a wall behind me so I can't, what I'm gonna do is reach forward, forward, forward, forward, reach, reach, reach, reach, reach, and no hand stand. All right. So then we end in mountain post, in stead, of just with the kids all over the place. Okay so come to stand in mountain pose feet above hip with apart, shoulders relax, check in make sure you knees aren't locked maybe even give your fingers little wiggle. And then turn your palms to face forward. If it feels good to you close your eyes for a moment and just find your steady balance. Take moment to feel your feet on the floor and feel where your body is in space. For me as I stand here, I can feel my body kind of leaning to the right a little and then back to the left. If I stand here for another second or two I might be able to slow that down and just find the middle. It's a good idea to start this practice with a solid, steady, rooted position. Now open your eyes and this breath of joy practice is gonna look like this. We're gonna take in inhale and lift our arms then another short inhale and bring the arms out to the sides. Then another inhale up so, it's three shot quick little inhales and then a long sighing exhale to fold forward and as I fold forward I'm softening my knees a little the forward fold is really droopy it's really just a little kind of wagged off letting go of the muscles. We're gonna do that repetitively. So, it's gonna look like this when we incorporate the breath. All right, you guys got it, I'm gonna show you the pattern one more time and then we'll do it all together. Inhale, inhale, inhale big exhale. Inhale, inhale, inhale, big exhale. Okay, so I'm gonna start and well what I usually do is I start fairly slow and the younger the kids are the slower I start, like really young kids preschool age kids, they can do this really slow. Then I'm gonna start to speed up you can speed up with me see what it feels like speeding it up can be very invigorating, what I always remind the kids what I'm doing this or really any other practice, but most especially ones that might be like overdoing it for individual kids, I always remind them, if something doesn't feel right for you stop if it doesn't feel right stop, pause, check it out, pay attention to what your body is trying to tell you and then make a decision about how to move forward. It doesn't mean if you don't like something or you don't want to do something just stop although, if a kid doesn't want to do something I would say stop and investigate check it out, why don't you want to do it? Alright make your own decision about how to go forward, but the language that I use here for these types of practices is, if something doesn't feel right, which is different from if you don't like something right, if something doesn't feel right for your body stop, that doesn't mean just stop and don't pay any attention to it stop and ignore it, stop and never try it again stop and investigate it, check it out, see what your body is telling you maybe your body is telling you this is too much for me I need a break. Maybe your body is telling you this is new and strange but I'm okay right so you got to stop and check it out listen to what your body is telling you and then make a decision about how to move forward. I always remind my kids anytime we're doing any practice that doesn't feel right for you what I want is for you to stop and check it out and make a decision about how to go forward. I reiterate it because the kids often don't believe it right there are so used to being in situations where to be doing the right thing means doing exactly what everyone else is doing they're used to getting in trouble when they deviate from what everyone else is doing so I find that I have to really hammer it in with my kids. Something doesn't feel right stop and then if the kid actually does it, I want to honor it, I want to say something like I'm so glad you noticed that that wasn't right for you and that you chose something else instead that you took a rest, that you change what you're doing that's exactly what we're going for, the ability to pay attention to what we need that to pay attention to what our body is telling us and to act accordingly. alright so let's give this a whirl and if it any point it's not feeling right for you just check it out and decide what to do about it. All right. Stand in the mountain pose for a moment. Perhaps put a hand on your heart and one on your belly. Just notice, how you're feeling. 

01:11:05

01:11:15
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER When you're, when you're ready open your eyes, bring your arms down. We're gonna come back to sit, but I'm gonna show you how I do that with my kids. So bring your arms up and come on to your tip toes and then slowly start to lower yourself down lower, lower, lower, lower, lower and stand. And then come a little lower, lower, lower and stand back up. And then start to slowly lower again. And this time come all the way down hover on your heels and then come to sit all right. Now, if you'd rather sit in a chair you can go ahead and move into a chair now. We're done with the standing for today. So those are our practices some that are calming some that are energizing but getting your kids into the habit of doing breath work practices and paying attention, noticing, how they make that individual child feel connecting to the body, connecting to the sensation, connecting to the experience, of the breath is a very empowering thing for our kids. Our breathing has a big, big impact on our physiology, but often we don't notice it we change our breathing but we just bypass all of the physical changes the sensations that occur helping our kids get connected not to the idea of this is supposed to be a calming breaths, this is supposed to be an energizing breath, but instead is really giving them the time in the space to explore to experiment and to see how their practices actually feel to them is really a wonderful, wonderful gift. We've got a couple more things to talk about here, now these practices are powerful which means that we have some safety considerations to discuss. First, as you begin to use these practices, keep in mind that I recommend no breath retention with children of any age. This is something breath retention is something that you might see in a yoga class, something you might experience, something you might even enjoy, often you'll go to yoga class and they'll say something like inhale retain the breath, which basically means hold your breath. Exhale. Retain the breath Inhale and so on and so on. That may be fine for adults, but for kids there's really not enough benefit to be worth the risk and I tend to think there is probably no benefit for kids at all in retaining their breath it's a very advanced breath work practice that takes a lot of awareness and control in order to be done safely, especially, their retention after the inhale right, remember the inhale as an energy rising part of the breath. So we're bringing energy up and then by retaining it we're keeping energy up for a lot of kids there's a fine, fine line between that energizing and anxiety producing. And inhaling and retaining that inhale for a lot of kid's, tips them into a place that's very, very anxious so, I would recommend absolutely no retention of the breath for your kids at all. The other thing that I avoid with my kids is extremely forceful breathing practices, such as ‘Kapalbhati' breathing or ‘Breath of Fire', these practices and if you don't know what they are don't worry about it, but if these are part of your own personal yoga practice know that I don't recommend you incorporating them into your work with children as you start to work possibly with older teens, you can explore them but I wouldn't do it unless I knew that those teens were really comfortable with me and willing to say, you know, what this doesn't feel right for me, but with younger kids I wouldn't do it, right these are both practices that emphasize very rapid very forceful movement of the breath they can easily cause lightheadedness anxiety and in extreme cases even respiratory difficulties and they just serve no essential function for our kids. So I recommend, No very forceful breath with the kids and then finally be aware that some people both kids and adults are like are sensitive to practices that empathize the inhale because of what we talked about earlier right, when you inhale and your energy rises for some people that rising energy slips into anxiety quickly. So you may experience some kids that are quite sensitive to extended inhalations. What I would suggest is again that you always remind them, if something doesn't feel right just stop. You can't keep all of your kids safe, by trying to know every individual child and how every individual kid's needs and background and past and physiology might interact with every single practice you offer them, it's gonna be impossible to keep them safe if you're relying on that method right the match between every child in every practice. Kids need to learn to keep themselves safe, but in order to do that they have to know that if they back off of something they're not gonna get in trouble or be judged or be disappointing you because of it. All right, so those are some general safety guidelines and then also we have some guidelines for ages, different ages of kids. So breath work practices can be explored safely by all ages of children, but modifications may need to be considered and made for their developmental capacity. Now if you're working with very young children between about two and four years old preschool age kids, the emphasis should be firmly on breath awareness and learning to slow the breath down, at this age some kids even have a hard time knowing if they're inhaling or exhaling. They literally don't know, am I am inhaling, am I exhaling what are those words even mean. So, at this age you might be focused on teaching them what inhale is, teaching them what an exhale is with little ones visualization such as imagine you're smelling a flower, imagine you're blowing a pin wheel right those type of visualizations can help them learn the difference between the inhale and the exhale and they can work very well, right keep, keep things really simple with your little ones often breathing in a way that they can see and hear yourself can help sometimes they have an easier time mirroring you than following your verbal instructions and I would definitely recommend using visual such as opening and closing the Hoberman Sphere with preschool age kids. Now as your kids get older, moving more into like the five to eight year old around, they can explore these practices more directly and dive in more in a more exploratory way to the relationship between the breath and their personal energetic experience and they can also more deliberately explore patterns and use counting to help them keep pace to their breaths. Now young, young kids preschool age kids sometimes can do the patterns with the counting as well, what I would say as your kids get older not only can they follow your count, but they can also explore what their own best count would be. So for example, in a long line of breathe and say you're working with a four year old, five year old, maybe you're always gonna count for them in how one two, exhale one, two, three, four as your kids get older you can say you know a two four pattern is great, but it's not necessarily the best pattern for everyone. Now the idea in the long in a breath is that we're taking a full inhale had just a normal full inhale and extending the exhale as long as possible. So as your kids get older you can let them explore it and say, "All right well, why don't you play with that see how many counts of full inhale would be for you and then see how many counts of slow exhale is for you." Okay now that's your long enough breath pattern, maybe it's three six or three eight or two five or whatever it is for you as your kids get older you can let them take more ownership of the practices bring their themselves into it more create patterns that work for them then help them create more personal practices. And then that can just expand as you start working with pre-teens and teenage students and clients, as your kids get older and move into the teen years, I would certainly encourage you to encourage them to find a daily practice a daily breath work practice that works for them on they can get very specific about understanding how these practices impact their energetic level, they can use the practices to regulate their own arousal and they can commit they can create and commit to daily home based practices of their own. Alright, finally, some notes about asthma and allergies and congestion these are things that often come up when working with kids when working with teens especially this time of year so, sinus congestion is tough for breath work right sinus congestion is really tough for breath work. Have tissues handy this is just hard I would certainly say, have tissues hand they always kind of offer kids pass tissues around, try to take this sort of stigma of having a stuffy nose or blowing your nose out of it just make it a normal thing every time we do the breath work the tissues go around and it's just no big deal right encourage kids to blow their nose before breath work practice and if you're encouraging kids to blow their nose make sure there's a garbage can handy or that they have a place to put it so it's not like surrounded by dirty tissues these logistical things are kind of you know important they make a difference in the experience. Encourage them to blow their nose before beginning breath work and then, if that's not enough if you're working with a kid who's really stuffy and they're just having a hard time something you can try is alternate nostril breathing, right this one. Alternate nostril breathing it's worth giving it a try a lot of times it can help clear up some of the congestion, but if the nose is just completely clogged right if there's nothing you can do about it the best thing that you can do is help that kid slow their breath way down if a child is forced to breathe through the mouth, the sympathetic nervous system is edgy that protective brain doesn't like it very much, the best thing you can do for that kid if they can't breathe through their nose is help them inhale and then slow the exhale down teach them to purse their lips really, really slow down the exhale. Finally, also recognize that if you've got a kid who's stuck breathing through their mouth, it's a likely that they'll be a little agitated and edgy just cut them some slack give them a break notice for yourself too when you have a really stuffy nose how are you feeling besides sick, how are you feeling energetically when you're forced to breathe through your mouth you're probably gonna be a little more reactive, a little more edgy, a little less thoughtful a little less capable of calming yourself down, so just know that if you work with a kid who's really congested it's gonna affect their energetic state in a way that they might not be able to do much about so just be compassionate towards that. Now, asthma is another consideration. I mentioned asthma earlier when I was talking about long in a breathing. A lot of times people are really nervous about practicing breath work with kids with asthma and I can understand that we certainly wouldn't want to do anything that would make it worse, but at the same time breath work practices can be extremely empowering for kids with asthma, you know, you're taking this thing the breath that has always had control over them that scares them, that can even cause them threat that can cause them harm, and you're saying you know you have some control over this scary thing, you can use this thing that has always been scary to you as a resource, right that that's a very empowering message and I would encourage you to think about how you can safely engage kids with asthma and breath work. Now a long in a breath is a wonderful practice for all the reasons we talked about earlier in engaging the exhalation making sure those kids really know how to empty their lungs completely so they have room for fresh oxygenated air to come in and then also think about avoiding very, very rapid inhalation so I would say of the practices that we did today, the only practice that I would really approach with caution. And I wouldn't scratch it off the list completely but I'd be cautious about it and not like do it on day one with kids with asthma is breath of joy where we're doing those three inhale, inhale, inhale because sometimes for some kids that rapid inhalation can be a little uncomfortable can kind of create a sensation of I can't quite breathe most kids have no problem with that at all and I say approach with caution not scratch it completely because every kid is different, every kid with asthma is different so I would teach them the other breath work practices first really get them comfortable with the idea that they own their breath and not the other way around and then feel it up you know feel it out and most importantly remind them if something doesn't feel right stop right, Stop, if you're practicing breath of joy and you're getting anxious or getting light headed or you're feeling uncomfortable, maybe the best course of action is just to come to sit down and practice hard and belly breath instead. And all the kids I know what all the kids I work with know that that's something that not only do I allow I encourage, even if we're in a group setting it doesn't matter if something doesn't feel right and you need to do something different from the rest of the group, that's exactly what I want to do. So promoting self-awareness and choice since our last slide, this is exactly what I was just talking about. So remember that individual experiences of these practices vary what does that mean just because I said this practice is usually calming for most people doesn't mean that it is calming for every single person in every single situation. Remember personal experiences of the exact same practice can vary so you always want to honor the kid's personal experience and not push your version of what you think they should feel like on to them what they feel is what's real. So support each child in interpreting the effect for themselves always, always allowed children to modify or opt out of any part of the practice or all of the practice and encourage them to go at their own pace on their own terms. And finally, last time I'm gonna say it, if something doesn't feel right encourage your kids to stop. Check it out and make their own decision about how to move forward. Alright so I'm gonna pause here and see if there's any questions at all. We're gonna give just a moment if anybody's got a question feel free to send it in we do have a couple of minutes.
