DANIEL SIEGEL  Now, we’ll be speaking about clinical implications of neuroplasticity. We’ll be diving into a blast discussion of information about this exciting field of neuroscience that allows us to see how experience changes the function and structure of the brain. So, neuroplasticity refers to the nervous system, that’s the neuro part, plasticity is the word for actually how things are changeable by experience, that’s actually what plastic means. And we were looking at the clinical implications of this work through the lens of the field I work in called interpersonal neurobiology. So for any clinician helping an individual, couple, family or group of individuals change whatever form of psychotherapy and venue your working, understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can help tremendously. In fact, we could say that for psychotherapy of any sort to have a long lasting impact on our clients, on our patients, on the individuals that we help, we need to change their brains. Now, we’ll see in a subsequent talk that it isn’t just trying to change the brain, but actually trying to promote integration in the brain that it need a personal neurobiology, IPNB, we view as the fundamental basis of cultivating wellbeing. But for now, let’s focus on the general idea of how does experience change the structure of the brain, and what do we know about the factors in our lives that actually support this change. So, the first thing to say is something that might be surprising, but relationships are one of the most important kinds of experiences that support the changing of the brain in a healthy direction. In terms of health, we know from studies of medical health, mental health, longevity, and even studies of wisdom and happiness that relationships are the foremost feature of a life that has positive attributes, happiness, wisdom, wellbeing, even physiological health. And one thing we can do, if that we do an IPNB, is look deeply at how a relationship influences, how the brain functions and how the brain structure changes in response to those experiences. And so, we have a series of deep scientific analysis that demonstrate that basically a relationship is the sharing of energy and information and a positive relationship would be a relationship that supports the differentiation of individuals in a relationship, honoring differences but then promoting linkages. And so whether you see a romantic relationship, a friendship, a relationship among colleagues, or you look at relationships that are less symmetric, for example between a teacher and a student, between a parent and a child, or between a therapist and a client or patient, all of these relationships thrive when differences are honored and linkages are promoted. What’s a linkage? A linkage would be compassionately communicating with the person you are in a relationship with. What’s differentiation? Allowing you to have different likes and interest in activities than the other person in the relationship and honoring those differences, not humiliating a person by demeaning them for being different from you for example. When we link differentiated parts we promote integration, and this is our hypothesis in IPNB about why relationships are one of the most important features to health. But what is this have to do with neuroplasticity? What I want to suggest to you is that experiences change the structure of the brain, that’s neuroplasticity, by way of the energy and information that experiences inspire a brain to have that they literally breathe life into the firing of certain circuits, that’s what inspire actually means, they activate certain circuits. So, experience for us at this moment in this blast can be thought of as that which induces neural firing patterns. Now, what do we know about neural firing patterns? Neural firing patterns are the way in which neurons, the basic cell of nervous system and in particular it will talk about the head part of the nervous system that most people call the brain, but keep in mind you also have a kind of brain in your intestines and you have a brain around your heart. So, there is a heart brain and a gut brain and there is a head brain, but in general people often use the word brain and they limit it to the skull. But when we say brain in IPNB, we really mean the whole embedded nervous system. That tends to people get nervous, so I try not to say nervous system, so let’s just say brain. The head brain basically has been studied in, you know, a lot of detail about how it changes in response to experience. And here is what we understand from a wide range of studies, some of which have been honored in terms of the work of Eric Kandel with Nobel Peace Prize. Okay, so what do we know? We know that neural firing means that a long length of an axon, this is the part that extends out from the cell body of a neuron, it has a membrane. And in this membrane you have ions that are on the inside and the outside of the membrane. If you open up ion channels and allow membranes to exchange across the membrane as this exchange moves down the membrane that’s called an action potential. It’s similar to the movement of charged particles that we call a current of electricity, but usually we think of electricity is a wire with electrons moving and this is a little different, but it is the movement of a charge. As this depolarization, there is movement of charge extends down the axon. What happens is at the distal end, as you probably you can guess, is you have packets of neurotransmitters such as dopamine or serotonin or acetylcholine that get released into the space between the downstream neuron and the upstream neuron, in other words, this movement of the action potentials in the presynaptic neuron is going to come to the space called the synapse and the neurotransmitter gets released from the vesicles, diffuses across the small space called the synapse, the receptors in the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will receive that neurotransmitter and depending on whether those transmitters are activating or inhibitory they will either activate, meaning they will lead to ion channels opening and an action potential streaming down from the dendrite-cell body that has the receptors down through the downstream axon of the postsynaptic cell in this two neuron connection. If it’s an inhibitory neurotransmitter, the polarization of the charges will be just the opposite and they will make the action potential less likely to happen at that moment. And the balance of excitatory versus inhibitory neurotransmitters determines ultimately whether that action potential either fires or doesn’t. So, we don’t say that an action potential is trickling down, it either fires or it doesn’t and that’s the balance of the relative input of excitatory or inhibitory transmitter release at the level of the dendrite-cell body where you have the receiving ends or the receptors for this process. Okay, so, neural firing happens in that fashion and the general thing that we understand is that there are 100 billion neurons in the head brain and they are supported by trillions of glial cells called oligodendrocytes and astrocytes that change the vascular input of nutrients to these activated cells and you see this change in blood flow in a functional MRI, for example, or you have the supportive cells that actually wrap these glial cells that is going to wrap myelin around interconnected neurons. And myelin allows two things to happen, it allows the speed of the action potential to increase by 100 times. So the action potential raises down the axon a 100 times faster and after a neuron fires, it needs to relax a little bit in something called a refractory period or resting period. With myelin, the refractory is 30 times faster. If you do your math, 30 times 100 is 3,000. If you have laid down myelin, which is what we lay down when we develop skills, so when you watch the Olympics you see these very skill athletes do their work and you say I can’t do that. If you haven’t put in the often over 10,000 hours of practice that those athletes have put in, you won’t have the myelin coded interconnected neurons that allow them to do things 3,000 times faster and more efficient than you can, and so you’re right, you can’t do that. So, myelin is the way neuroplasticity responds to practice. Synapse connections strengthening with increasing receptors and release some neurotransmitter or just creating new synapses, so synapse formation and modulation is another way. So, we have myelin connecting neurons making them more effective and how they communicate with each other, we have the creation of synaptic connections and with a 100 billion neurons, if I’m an average neuron, you know how many connections, synaptic connections, I make with other neurons? 10,000. So, there are 100 billion neurons and 10,000 connections establishing a spider web like set of interconnections that makes four trillions of connections among the spider web like interconnected neural network. Some people say, in fact, this is the most complex system that which is in your head in the universe, in your head. Now you can say, all those people saying it is just in their head, but actually when you look at the mathematics of it, the number of possible on/off firing patterns in your head brain has been calculated to be a number that’s larger than the atoms in the known universe. Now, it might, I didn’t say the number of synaptic connections, no, I said the number of on/off combinations, the number of possible on/off firing patterns is calculated to be about ten times, ten 1 million times, which is a number larger than how many atoms there are in the universe. Now, when you add to that, what we are discussing today which is neuroplasticity, you realize that’s it’s the brain continues to grow not just in childhood and that lesson, but throughout the lifespan and experience continues to mold synaptic connections, myelin formation, even the growth of new neurons in an area called the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. So, there maybe even other areas but we know neurogenesis, a third kind of growth of neuroplasticity happens, and we’ll talk about that in a moment, but even when you add neuroplasticity you can say that the number of firing patterns is virtually infinite, because we keep on changing our brains. So when an adolescent or another person say, I am bored with life, it isn’t just they living in London, it’s that they are entrapping into the vast potential of firing patterns. And it isn’t so much that we don’t use parts of our brain, lot’s of the brain is always being used, it’s just that the way we can use our brains, has infinite potential. And that’s an exciting finding for us as clinicians and educators and parents and people on the planet just to know about. So, to just finish up the major ways in which the brain change, we’ll do that on another slide with something called epigenetic changes and we’ll talk more about neurogenesis. But just keep in mind that there are things that support the healthy growth of the brain with experience and part of what you need to do as an educator is that, is as a clinician, is educating people about neuroplasticity is you need to understand what are the factors you can suggest to your clients, your patients, your students, to optimize the way their brain grows in response to the specific experiences you’ll provide. And you see on this slide, a list of factors that helps promote growth in the brain in response to experience whether it’s neurogenesis or synaptogenesis or myelin formation, relationships, sleep; sleep is profoundly important. And in fact, sleep has been show when it’s deficit, when you don’t get enough sleep, it will seriously affect cognitive function as well as increase stress as well as to alter even metabolic functioning. So, your risk of getting diabetes and the ability to deal with sugar is changed when you don’t have enough sleep. When you just think about how kids and especially teenagers are incredibly sleep deprived and you think about how electronic things stimulate our brain and wake us up, we need to have a sleep hygiene approach, such as turning off digital objects an hour before you want to sleep, such as making sure that you get seven to eight hours of sleep, not five to six hours. The majority of human beings require seven to eight hours of sleep, even as you get older. Kids and teenagers may require even more, eight, nine, ten hours of sleep perhaps. So, we need to realize that when schools demand kids to get up and if you have children or adolescent as your clients or patients, they may not be learning as well in school or even in therapy because they are sleep deprived. So, if you want to really help your therapy be effective, help your clients and patients get to sleep. Okay, nutrition. Nutrition is also very important, especially the adequate intake of healthy forms of omega-3 fatty acids, lot of people like to get that from fish, which is fine. Fishes harder to come by and it’s expensive. So we need to think about this that, we evolved near bodies of water and it looks like we ate fish and this was a source of brain health. And we aren’t eating as much fish and healthy supplies of fish are diminishing, so we need to really think deeply about what this maybe and in terms of education and psychotherapy, and in general nutritional approaches as well, so nutrition very, very important. Aerobic exercise; your clients, your patients should be exercising, if they medically can do that. There is beautiful work on how aerobic exercise, that’s not the only exercises important in general, weight training is good to you but aerobic exercise in particular supports neuroplasticity, the brain growing in response to experience. There is some fascinating new studies out that show that even weight training, it can help support the brain approaching cognitive challenges with more efficiency and learning more effectively, learning is based on neuroplasticity. Novelty is the offering of new events, new things. And the brain responds novelty, it attracts our attention, it revs us up. And so novelty, for most people maybe not shy people, but for most people it can help us. Shy individuals withdraw from novelty and they take a while to warm up to it, so ultimately it can be helpful for them. One component of novelty that I like to think about is humor. And the studies are just emerging now, but it looks like laughing helps your brain grow. And those are in a strong, in terms of novelty issues, but the humor is often where you are presenting some material and then you give a deviation that surprises someone, surprises the audience. And so, laughing with your clients, not laughing at them but laughing with them, is really important part of a therapy experience, I think, but also it’s very important in a person’s life on a daily basis to have some real laughter, some enjoyments, some sense of joy, sense of surprise and if possible, have some belly laughter. There are some fascinating studies that are just emerging on laughter even when it’s just induced to laugh, where you are not laughing at something and there appears to be something about laughter that is health promoting and we’ll have to wait for those more definitive studies to come out but why not give it a try. And so there is a laughing yoga and all sorts of laughing things that you can, you can encourage yourself to give it a try and then see how your clients do with that. Finally there is the close paying of attention. And this is phrases way, because attention is the way energy and information flows through the nervous system in specific kinds of patterns. The phrase close paying is important because you can have you attention here, and attention there, and attention there, and attention there, which is either in multi-taking which does not lead to increase neuroplasticity, studies are very clear about that, or there is a term that’s been created that talks about the multiple shifting in attention which isn’t so much doing things all at once, but it’s continuous partial attention is I think the phrase that has been coined. This idea that you are paying partial attention here, okay I’m not going do that anymore, your partial attention here, no I can’t do it, now that overlaps in multi-tasking but it captures little different quality of it, that were never fully paying attention to something. As a writer myself, I’m often concerned about the ways in which information is presented in incredibly short spurts, like short little paragraphs if you will read on the internet or very short presentations that don’t require a lot of close paying of attention over an extended period of time and so the material that’s presented is actually quite surfacy and so people are getting accustomed to not having the diligence to go deeply into a topic and I’m actually concerned about that. But anyway the close paying of attention does a couple of things. It specifically channels energy and information flow through circuits in the brain and in the localized areas what we believe happens is, brain-derived neurotrophic factor is released in localized regions that are firing and if I release, if these are two neurons that are firing, I’m going to increase their synaptic connectivity by the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor near there that actually activates the genetic material in the presynaptic cell in the nucleus of that cell and what that means to activate genes is crucial to understand in neuroplasticity. Gene activation means that the double helix DNA on ravels became single-stranded momentarily, RNA is transcribed single-stranded nucleic acids from the deoxyribonucleic acid, single-stranded ribonucleic acid is transcribed from the sequences of nucleotides on the DNA, it leaves the nucleus that single-stranded RNA and goes out and it’s translated along a ribosome, these sequences of nucleotides in the RNA are translated into a sequences of amino acids that make a proteins that allow the function and structure of the cell in this case of neuron to change. And so synaptic growth, neurogenesis, myelin formation depends on gene expression. Gene expression then is the mechanism that allows neuroplasticity. So, what we are saying is that neural firing is what makes gene expression possible. Okay so, we have action potentials flowing down neuron, we have that set up, not always, but possibly with the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, it increases the likely hood that the genes that will increase the connectivity among neurons will be enhanced. With close paying attention, the second mechanism that we believe happens is that just above the brainstem is an area called the nucleus basalis. And one leading theory says that the nucleus basalis secretes acetylcholine when the brainstem and other regions are having you focus close attention on something. So, the brainstem alerts you to the importance of something, the anterior cingulate, which is a part of the limbic area and some people places a part of the prefrontal cortex, it’s going to also allocate attentional resource and together these limbic prefrontal and brainstem mechanisms focus your attention and the nucleus basalis gets in and acts as Hey!, you know, if you are focusing close attention, I’m going to secrete acetylcholine globally all over the place. And here is the secret, when a acetylcholine is globally secreted, the areas that are firing intensely are more likely to engage gene activation. When you combine localized BDNF secretion with those neurons that are firing and the secretion of BDNF in that location and the close paying of attention by the attentional circuitry from the prefrontal region, the doors of lateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate and the brainstem areas that are involved in a arousal and attention. When all of that’s happening, the nucleus basalis says go, secrete acetylcholine. The acetylcholine then works with the BDNF that’s locally secreted and those neurons that are firing together, wired together. And that’s a phrase that Carla Shatz summarize the work of Donald Hebb from 1949 in a book called the Organization of Behavior, everyone attributes that to Donald Hebb but actually it was Carla Shatz, a neuroscientist, now at Stanford. So, this is what we know about neuroplasticity, relationship, sleep, nutrition, aerobic, exercise, novelty including humor, and the close paying of attention all support the growth of new connections in the brain and psychotherapy benefits by how you can harness the supports of neuroplasticity in a therapeutic way which will talk about little bit this talk but a lot in the next talk. So, how do we change the brain? What are the mechanisms of change? We’ve now covered three of the one's here on the left, synaptogenesis, we’ve talked about the formation and modulation of synapses. Neurogenesis, let’s cover that a little bit more. In the brain you have something called neural stem cells, especially in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The hippocampus is, if you put your thumb in the middle of your fingers, in the middle of your palm, put your fingers over your thumb, this would be a pretty handy model in the brain and we’ve got the spinal cord coming up here, the face of the person here, top of the head here. So, if you lift up your fingers and lift up your thumb, you got your spinal cord and then your brainstem deep here with the reticular activating system waking you up in the brainstem and fight-flight- freeze mechanism there. The nucleus basalis will sit on top of that, you’ve already got the cerebellum behind it which helps actually coordinating not only motor behavior but also cognition and emotion interactions. And then you have your limbic area, if you put your thumb over you’d have two thumbs to make a great model. This limbic area includes the amygdala which places emotional texture on certain experiences, the hippocampus which is crucial for learning, especially taking the initial imprinting of experience on our emotions or behaviors or perceptions even the mental models we have, those are called implicit elements of memory and weaving them together by the hippocampus to form explicit memory which has two kinds, there is factual memory, especially meditated in left hemisphere and there is autobiographical memory, sense of self in time in the right hemisphere in a dominant way. Hippocampus is very important, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus starts developing around 18 months of age, which is when kids start developing explicit memory and this period before the dentate gyrus develops we called the first phase of childhood amnesia. So most people only have implicit memory for the first 18 months of life, even sometimes the first two or three years of life. Once the hippocampus starts going, it starts integrating these early imprints of experience in terms of their implicit forms makes factual and autobiographical memory and so the hippocampus is very, very important. Trauma, negatively impacts the hippocampus, shrinks it by way we believe of cortisol secretion, excess of stress hormone secretion. So, coming back to neurogenesis, the one place in the brain that we know we have neural stem cells is the hippocampus and it may end up we’ll find them in other areas, but for now, that’s where we know it is. Now, what happens, you have the turn over about everyday of the neural stem cells so that it divides into two cells. Once you have these two cells, then one maintains the stem cell line and the other is called the daughter cell, I don’t know why it’s not called as son cell, but anyway this daughter cell, if this novelty going on in the close paying of attention, this daughter cell, once that was withering away and dying can start differentiating into a fully developed neuron with dendritic receiving ends, also receptors on the cell body and an axon that goes out and now it’s going to start making connections to other neurons, synaptic connections. So, neurogenesis takes a stem cell daughter, stimulates it to say, Hey! Don’t die. Why don’t you grow into a part of the nervous system and get integrate into the whole nervous system by developing synaptic connections to your cousins. That’s basically neurogenesis. Aerobic exercise have been shown the increased neurogenesis and the elaboration of these daughter cells into fully functioning neurons and that can take anywhere from, you know, six to eight weeks to establish herself as a neuron that would be respected by your colleagues in the neuron world. And so it’s interesting that in a psychotherapeutic encounter, some events happen very rapidly, insides changes and emotional states, capacity regulate alteration and dissociation, if you work in that field, also certain things can happen very rapidly. So, memory can happen by synapse formation. Skills can develop over many, many hours, for example, developing mind sight skills where you see the internal world of the mind, that can develop over a long periods of times, months at a time people can develop deeper and deeper skills. Neurogenesis, you know, we don’t know exactly how that happens in psychotherapy, but there is a feeling sometimes you get a period of quiescence that after an intense period of work in psychotherapy. A few months can go by and then there is a kind of a consolidation of learning even if the person is been on vacation or even if you have them working on things in a very intensive way that even come up. And there can be in this consolidation the feeling I have it maybe just a guess, or it just a guess it maybe not accurate, but is that there is neurogenesis has created these differentiated daughter cells which are now going to establish their integrated functioning in the brain and it just takes a few months for it to become mature. So, you may find that in the work that you do. Okay. Now on the left hand column here we also have epigenesis. What’s that? DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is a sequence of nucleotides that make up our genes. Collections in nucleotides are all strong together on a limited number of chromosomes, these long strands of DNA. Now, while the sequence of nucleotides determines the kinds of amino acids and the sequence of them that determine what is the nature of the protein that’s produce that determines the structure and function of the cell, liver cell, heart cell and neuron cell, there are other molecules that sit on the chromosome that are not nucleotides. These are for example, histones or methyl groups, and you don’t need to worry about what they are but just know that they are not nucleotides. They sit on the chromosome and they have the function of determining which genes get expressed and how they get expressed. Now, what is this mean? Well this is very exciting because it means that for neurogenesis and synaptogenesis and myelinogenesis you are going to be activating genes, great that’s what neuroplasticity is based on. Neuroplasticity requires gene expression, fine. But gene expression is dependent on gene expression regulation which is shaped not just by experience but by the epigenetic molecules, histones and methyl groups that sit in particular places on the chromosome. Now, why is this important? Well, this is important for a couple of reasons. Number one, we now know that a gene just sitting in a nucleus of a cell that doesn’t get expressed meaning the double helix DNA does not ravel and become single-stranded RNA which goes out and becomes on the ribosome then becomes proteins that’s gene expression. Genes which just hang out in the nucleus and aren't expressive, have no impact for the most part on the person. So gene expression is very important. Think about it like this, if you had a library and the books would be equivalent to the genes and if a book was never allowed to be read in the library some librarian for some reason he put this book away in a closet and lock the closet and you, a citizen, go into the library to see what’s going on and you don’t find that book as it’s been locked away. That librarian would have made it so the information that the author put in the book would never impact the world. So, epigenetic molecules are kind of like the librarians in an office and the librarians in a library, the maintainers of who reads what when, and so they are important. They didn’t write the book, but they can determine whether that book has any impact whatsoever. Alright, so epigenetic molecules don’t change the book, they don’t add at the book, they just determine if you as a citizen are going to read the book or not. How’s that related to neuroplasticity? Well, here is the amazing finding. Experience not only requires gene activation but experience the firing of neurons changes the molecules that regulate gene expression. That’s fact number one. So, experience not only effects the connection among neurons in terms of neurogenesis, creating new neurons, synaptogenesis making new connections and myelinogenesis, you know, making the connections 3,000 times more effective, all good, all these are the neural pathway and how information and energy is flowing down, all fine. But experiences also molding the very molecules the librarians that are going to control when and which and how those genes will be expressed. That’s fact number one. Studies by Michael Meaney and colleagues at McGill in Montreal and Canada have demonstrated sadly that in people who’ve been severely negatively affected like an abuse, the part of the brain that regulates emotional balance has its epigenetic controls, negatively influenced by the abuse, so that not only as abuse raising all sorts of vulnerable experiences for the child and that attachment is not providing them to be seen, safe and sure, so they are not secure and that creates of course a relational violation to what we’ve all in terms of having security. But now we know that the very experience of abuse will secrete cortisol and studies by Martin Teicher and also by Debella suggests that this increased cortisol is going to negatively impact the growth and even the life of certain cells especially the integrated fibers of the brain such as the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus and the corpus callosum that connects the left and right side of the brain. So, when relationships are not integrative as an abuse or neglect, the cortisol secretion affects the integrative fibers of the brain from growing or even surviving and the integrative fibers are the fibers that allow regulation. Okay, so that we know just as an anatomical reality, sadly and the timing of the abuse or neglect determines which neurons will be negatively affected. So in general, we need to know when the abuse and neglect happen to know exactly which of these integrative fibers are the most dominantly negatively affected, alright. But what Michael Meaney also showed in addition to that work of Teicher and Debella’s and others, is that there won’t only be an impact on the connections among neurons, there is also a negative impact on the epigenetic molecules that control gene expression that helps develop healthy emotion regulation. So in other words, you’re not only having deficient integrative fibers available to regulate well, but now the functioning of those neurons and the growth of them negatively impacted by the epigenetic changes. So that serious business, and it means that our work as therapists needs to look at what’s the fundamental mechanism and I would suggest you from an IPNB point of view, it’s integration and then how can we stimulate these neurons to grow in integrative ways. The second fact that you need to know as a clinician is that studies that have been done in Scandinavia, in Israel and also studies done by Michael Meaney in other arenas with non-human animals suggest that these epigenetic changes are actually passed through your sperm and your eggs. So, what this means is that, if your grandparents or your parents had challenging if not traumatizing experience a famine, the holocaust, abuse, that you don’t get a change in nucleotide sequences, that does not happen from experience. Okay, but experience that they had, negative experiences that they had, will affect the way the epigenetic molecules are formed even in the egg and the sperm, and that your parents will inherit their parents epigenetic changes and you can inherit from grandparents you may never have met their epigenetic changes that were done in response to the famine or the holocaust. So, we need to realize that as clinicians if you are hearing it for the first time, I know for many people it’s extremely upsetting, what we don’t know which I’m hoping will learn in the near future is that psychotherapy can correct those epigenetic changes, and let me underscore this, we don’t know that, no one studied it, but my feeling is if the epigenetic changes are part of neuroplasticity and negative experiences can negatively impacted, why wouldn’t positive experiences help change the epigenetic regulatory molecules in a positive way, just like we believe the research hasn’t fully end but we are seeing some supportive evidence of it, that corrective therapeutic experiences probably, I underscore probably, we haven’t proven this yet, probably grow the integrative fibers of the brain. And that’s why therapy works. I’ll propose to you, because we are harnessing the neuroplastic capacities to use our relationships and the way we help clients and patients focus attention to help them grow integrative fibers, so that even if there has been damage from abuse and neglect. In most cases, you can inspire the individual to rewire their brains toward integration. Okay, so how do we do that? These are the strategies of change and these are really take home points in the book called Mindsight and in the book called The Mindful Therapist, you will find detailed examples, clinical examples, of how to do this for yourself and for your clients, your patients, and so these are just kind of the highlights the specific clinical interventions are derived from these basic principles. So, here is how they go. Number one, your relationship with the client or the patient allows you to develop a sense of trust. Okay, your presence as a therapist and you are tuning to the internal experience of you client, your patient, allows you to resonate with them and develop trust, I think about that with the PART we play, PART, Presence, Attunement, Resonance and Trust, so that’s the second point here. And ultimately with that receptive learning state that you help create and Steve Porges in our interpersonal neurobiology series we have these three dozen text books now and you can see in his Polyvagal Theory book, beautiful detailed mechanisms, hundreds of pages if you want to read it, beautiful book describing how relationships create this trusting state through different mechanisms of communication. Ultimately, psychotherapy requires that we help our patients, our clients move from reactivity to receptivity and that develops a sense of trust. Then once we do that, we can focus attention in very specific ways. So your job as a clinician in many ways, there is a neuro sculpture. The focus of attention drives energy and information through your client and patients nervous system in a way that their overarching view will promote differentiation and linkage that are the foundations of integration. So, just like a surgeon uses a scalpel to do brain surgery, we as clinician use a relationship and the focus of attention to sculpt the synaptic connections in the brain, that’s what we do. So, what we need to think about when you think from this perspective, and I know most of us, at least I was not trained this way, and most of the therapist I meet are not trained this way, but now from this IPNB point of view, we have the framework to say, our job as clinicians is to develop the trust within the Presence, Attunement, Resonance and Trust that we can create as PART we play. And then we focus attention on specific domains of integration that reveal chaos or rigidity and then we find where differentiation is needed and that’s the focus of attention to stimulate the growth of that region of the brain and those functions that emanate from that area of the brain and then linked them together in ways that are a part of the whole process of integration. Now some people who’ve been traumatized to have encoded memories of trauma, this memory retrievals and memory modifier and the good news is and this is supported by our discussion of the Adult Attachment Interview and in general work with memory that it isn’t what happen to us is how we come to make sense of what happen to us and Bob Burek, my memory research mentor from UCLA hear this beautiful phrase that memory retrieval can be a memory modifier. And what does that mean? When you activate certain neural firing patterns instead of staying fixed neuroplasticity tells us to actually can change when retrieval is entered into awareness. Every form of psychotherapy that I’ve been able to hear about, the ones that have been proven and you know research proven evidence based stuff, but that’s a very rare form of therapy. Many therapies probably they work fine, but just haven’t had the research backup to show them actually all involve awareness. So awareness is a space we’ll talk about more in the next section of the seminar, that allows memories to be sorter through and for the way they are re-encoded in the brain to be modified. And that’s the beautiful work of Bob Burek BJ or RK. And Bob has also taught us the importance of distinguishing learning, like developing new synaptic connections from unlearning. So part of our task as therapist is to make sure we keep track of that. Yes, our clients need to learn new stuff for sure. But often they need to unlearn habits that have been self disruptive and non-productive. So knowing these different distinctions is very important. Interestingly one of the theories about unlearning involves a hormone that you probably know about called oxytocin and oxytocin seems to allow unlearning. It's kind of like the Crosby, Stills & Nash song love the one you’re with because when you make love you secrete oxytocin so just be careful of who you spent time with. In sheep for example and the bonding of the mother to the baby sheep is fine and it's aided by oxytocin, but then when a new baby is born and the baby sucks at the nipple of the mother, she secrets oxytocin allows her to unlearn her bonding to the older one, let him skittle off and now born to the new one. I’ll show some example of why oxytocin would be important for unlearning things and then supporting new bonding. Deep practice and skill training is this idea that to really develop skills well. We need to actually focus on that, which is most difficult. So it is just that oh, I can play this well, and I keep on playing it over and over again. I think that was my experience as a guitar player, I learned one thing and now 40 years later it's the same one thing I can play. The idea of developing a skill is not to just stick with what you are familiar with, what you are comfortable with or you okay of doing, but actually to push to your weaknesses to go where it scary, to move into the unknown. And a lot of people resist that, I know I get with guitar and it had its negative consequences. For our clients, our patients this often has gotten them stuck you know rut and so a part of what we need to realize as clinicians is deep practice and skill training requires that a person sit and be aware of what they are not so good at. So we, yes we want to emphasize the positive. Yes, we want to look at the positive attributes in personal life and their strengths and all that stuff absolutely, but deep change doesn’t happen that way by just focusing on what keys you can play. It's really looking at the hard places in your life, the dark places. The places you don’t want to go. And that’s where, you know Lev Vygotsky always taught us Russian psychologist from the last century taught us about this thing called the zone of proximal development for optimal growth happens when a support of other realizes that, this is the zone here. People like kids or even clients and patients can do this amount without anyone's support. But with our support they can move into this zone and move up to here. So in a tune parent or a tune teacher you know have you consider in a tuned clinician feels intuitively where that zone is, focus his attention with their client to what they can do with the support of the therapist, allows him to practice that in a session and gives them skills homework, skills training work to actually do that outside of the session because another lesson from neuroplasticity is you can’t just see a patient once a week. You can see them once a week, but you got to hear them homework to do every day. So in mind sight training, we give them reflective practices to do every day. You can have them write in a journal or whatever it's very important from a neuroplasticity point of view to make sure that you keep the training focused even sometimes you can do intensive three-hour sessions and then maybe let that be something that writes the person on then you do one-hour sessions after that. But there is something about mast practice and then daily refreshing of what you’re learning that’s very very important and it isn’t often what we do in our training of therapist. Right, so let’s do a few more and feel free to get ready to rate questions in, because we’ll taking questions and I'll address though once it came in, after we ended our last session too, here is some of the lessons from neurobiology. We know that, there are divisions in neurobiology that really all of overlap even though in a research setting they are separate. Effective neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience developments on neuroscience, social neuroscience for me as an interpersonal neurobiologist, these are all a part of one whole even though you need to know that research has to by definition be very focused on what it looks at, to be able to empirically validate often with numbers, what’s going on and so in doing that, you get different divisions. But a human being, your patient, your client is a whole being. They are not just here is my effective side, here is my cognitive side. All those things that are studied in separate ways are all a part of a whole. So if you like reading the research literature, which I find incredibly fascinating to do. Just keep in mind that the incredibly hard work of researchers pays-off when they narrow their focus and ask very specific questions. That’s the way science advances. That’s fantastic. In clinical work, we don’t do that. We have a whole human being that comes to us and when I was in pediatrics I was always struck by there will be specialist in pediatrics, who specialize in the kidney and the intestines and the heart and then the brain and skin and everyone was separate and yet when I as a primary care pediatrician would see a kid, I would see the family and I’d see the parents and I’d see the kid and I'd realize his whole body with a whole body. And yet the specializations where the way we could kind of try to get our arms around the science. So as clinicians as educated parents and what we do in inter-personal neurobiology we say hey, what if you combine all the scientists together into one perspective. What if you found the universal principles across all those disciplines, and that’s what we do. So today we’re looking at one aspect of science neuroplasticity and how experience shapes the brain, but we’re making a larger statement that neural integration how convergent sounds mediate complex mental processes is actually truly what we’re interested in as clinicians. Yes, neuroplasticity is really important if I gets essential first to know about. But how you’re going to try to change your clients’ brain? And I want to urge you to consider that self regulation what we want our clients to result in after therapy for to be effective actually is an outcome of brain activation states when they are integrated, when they are coordinated and balanced. So we’re moving from a simple talk on neuroplasticity, which is fine, but not enough to saying what is mental health, what is, toward the mind is, but when you look at the mind as both a relational and embodied process that’s self organizing and emergent so that it rises as energy and information flows through both the body and between us so both within and between this is self organizing emergent process, which is one part of what the mind is, beyond consciousness, beyond subjective experience, what we do in IPNB is offer a definition of the mind. Now strangely I've asked one hundred thousand mental health practitioners if they’ve ever had a lecture on the mind. All around our planet from every discipline of mental health you can imagine and what do you think the answer has been everywhere I’ve gone, who ever I’ve asked, psychiatry, psychology, social work, nursing, educational therapy, occupational therapy, music therapy you name it no matter what country I’m in everywhere what’s the percentage? A hundred thousand individuals face to face I’ve asked, the answer is, 2% to 5% say YES. Well, over 95% of all the therapist that I’ve been able to interview and I think it's a pretty good sample a hundred thousand individuals 95% at a minimum say I’ve never had even a single lecture what the mind is. And yet these are all mental health practioners, now before we get to embrace, which I certainly am, we need to realize that the field of psychology in general does not have the definition of the mind. The field of education, which develops the mind in schools, does not have a definition of the mind even the field of philosophy of mind does not have a definition of mind. So we’re not alone, that should have us take a little bit of a breath, but not much because actually, what we need to do is realize that we can use this definition of mind to say, if the mind you may disagree with the definition, which is fine, like lot of people don’t disagree with the definition they just feel like, we shouldn’t define the mind, the scientist say because we limit ourselves and I say, hey if I’m a psychotherapist and I’m a therapist of the mind, how can I justify having people come to me and saying hey, I will help the therapist of your mind and then if the client says to me, oh, what is the mind Dan? And I say, I don’t know. Then how could I actually be a person putting up a single saying I’m a therapist of the mind because psycho course means soul, spirit, intellect and mind. So for me, this definition of mind is crucial even though I’m trained as a scientist and some of my best friends are philosophers in psychology researchers I don’t think mental health can any more lack in definition of the mind. So I’m offering a tune, you can see what you feel about it. When you say the mind is regulatory, this one aspect of the mind, we’re not explaining away consciousness or subject of experience, but this third aspect of mind as regulatory tells us you can teach people to do the two processes of regulation and do it well. So you can strengthen their mind, what are they, think about when you regulate a car. You have to monitor where you’re going, and modify how you’re going. Monitoring and modifying are the two components of regulation. So once we say that you’re teaching someone to have a stronger mind, now because we have a definition of mind, you can say, okay I need to teach my clients to have a stable monitoring capacity so they see with more depth to tell and richness and once that image is stabilized energy and information flow where in the body and in relationships. Then you say okay, well how do I modify toward health, you modify toward integration. And that’s the whole kit and kaboodle. Okay, now because our brains are social, our brains are extremely social limbic areas involve and self regulation that work here in the thumb area and here in the middle prefrontal area, overlap of those involve in an interpersonal communication and plasticity. This is where you are narrow sculptor. Your relationship is not just coincidental with your power and efficacy and ability to actually inspire people to be wire their brains to an integration, it's essential. How one brain interacts with another has important effects on how the brain functions. That’s what we mean by a social brain. Social interactions are one of the most powerful forms of experience, that’s the neuroplasticity piece that help shape how the brain gives rise to the mind and in fact how the mind shapes the brain. This is the key thing. Alright, now if you take your hand model and look at the slide, you can see here can you see my little arrow, I don’t know if you can, so imagine let us see how I can do this with my finger, well you’ll see in the hand model, you have the prefrontal area here, which basically is integrating everything. You have the limbic area, where the mingle of the hippocampus for example in your thumb area and you have a deeper brain stem area below that thing they call the hippocampus. Basically the prefrontal region is profound the integrative. And if you can see this area here it links their whole cortex to the limbic area to the brain stem and even input from the body and there are mind sight maps, maps of other peoples’ minds that are created in this region as well. So the social, the somatic, the brain stem, the limbic and coracle five areas of independent encodes differentiated for sure neural input, social, somatic, brain stem, limbic and coracle are coordinated imbalance that’s what integration does, they're allowed to be differentiated and then they’re linked. They maintain their differentiation and then they are linked. So integrations not the same as homogenization, you’re not putting this thing in a blunder, it's not like a smoothie, it's more or like a fruit salad. So you are keeping the differentiated parts and then you’re linking it together. Now are these demands of innovation we’re not touching on, but just keep in mind that you can get extremely specific as a clinician as to what you’re trying to accomplish in sculpting the neuroplastic capacity of your clients brain to become more integrated. So this isn’t just some willy-nilly hey, let’s just throw in the brain here is a fun little thing I’ve seen people change their slides and just put in brain change, brain change I tell how you change the brain, they all don’t know, well I’m trying to be really specific in what we’re recommending from an IPNB point of view is that you detect where integration is impaired whether it's developed mentally like an attachment of difficulties or it's a genetic cause of impaired integration. In fact, just I’ll say it here, chaos and rigidity are the outcomes of impaired integration if you look at the DSM, even non-experientially related disorders, in fact all the disorders in DSM you can see as examples of symptoms that are part of syndrome, that are all examples of chaos, rigidity or both. So from our point of view, integration leads to harmony. Impaired integration leads to chaos or rigidity and in the search for impaired integration that was proposed years ago now in the last decade we have evidence to suggest the disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder or all examples of impaired neural integration not caused by experience, but likely genetic or infectious cause or whatever is causing these disorders, they are still disorders of integration. At UCLA, there is work being done that is exploring how using mindfulness practices with women who want to get pregnant where bipolar disorder might help them develop their brains in a way so they can self regulate through growth of integrated fibers without the use of medications because they can’t be on medications when they are pregnant or if they are nursing. So for this reason, you might say, oh! wait a second, bipolar disorder is not caused by experience why would experience help the brain change, and here is the secrete, neuroplasticity experience changes the growth of the brain can happen even if it's genetically determined deficiency in integrative fibers, that’s the idea. So we have to be careful not to mix up Eyedeology like the cause of bipolar disorder is not attachment problems, but an attachment relationship using mindfulness skills, which I believe is a form of internal attunement that just like interpersonal attunement with secure attachment promotes the growth of integrative fibers, if you’ve read the mindful brain. You’ll see and if you read the mindful therapy, is your mind sight you'll get it to in all his books Pocket Guide to Interpersonal Neurobiology, this all the foundations of this, you’ll see the idea that even with a genetic pre-disposition that not have integration in your brain psychotherapy done with integration in mind can help promote growth of integrated fibers in the brain. That’s the proposal, the study is being done in UCLA 1 area and there are other places looking at other capacities as well. This is our hand model right here, we’ve already done this and you can see the parts of the brain, you know, the middle prefrontal cortex, it integrates everything, the cerebral cortex, the limbic areas and your thumb region, left and right and the brain stem and here the base of the skull and the spinal cord and now keep in mind there is also a left and right hemisphere and extremely controversial I’m not going to get into now, but they’re actually quite different from each other, there is a beautiful book by Iain McGilchrist called the Master and his Emissary and you know in some of our online stuff, we actually study his book and really go deep into left, right hemisphere differences. So I won’t go into it here, but keep in mind that when you’re trying to promote integration, which is honoring differences promoting linkages you really need to look at a deep analysis of the left and right hemisphere differences, but bear in mind that in the new millennium, it became politically incorrect in the field of neuroscience to talk about the differences between the left and right hemisphere with much bigger. And shockingly much of the incredible insights from clinical work from over a hundred years, experimental work from the last four years and then even research that comes out in last ten years supporting the quite differentiated left versus right hemisphere has been ignored and even how can I say it in a way that’s accurate. People make fun of you, if you talk about the left and right differences. That’s why I can say, so in all my writings where I talk about the differences, it was so rewarding to later heavy and McGilchrist come out with his deep analysis of left, right hemisphere research. And supporting the idea of their quite different. So this also that difference. Now what is the prefrontal region do? This is a fascinating list. If you’ve read the mind side book, you’ll know that this list came out years ago when I was working with the patient who had a car accident and injury to this area of the brain, right here, this area that connects the cortex, limbic area, the brain stem, the body proper and the social world and she damaged this so severely that she no longer have these nine functions, and these functions turns out how empirical validation that the various aspects of the middle prefrontal region contribute to them. Now what was amazing was that as an attachment researcher, it turns out that independent of my finding this list from just covering through the brain research literature at the library to take care of this patient, this turns out the first eight of the nine to be proven empirically demonstrate outcomes of what happens when you have secure attachment. Body regulation balancing the para sympathetic and sympathetic branches of the nervous system that go out and accelerate things the sympathetic function, as calm things down the parasympathetic attune communication tuning into another person’s internal world even tuning into your own for internal attunement and mindfulness, emotional balance allowing emotions to be raved up enough so life has meaning, but not too raved up so they are chaotic and wild. That’s the harmony of optimal integration. Fear extinction, modulating fear, so that you can approach things that before you avoid it. Response flexibility, flexibility is where you can pause before you act and consider various options that are the most productive for you and people around you. Insight, insight would be basically a mind sight map of me, where I’m now, where I’ve been in the past, where I’m going in the future. So Endel Tulving calls this mental time travel and he also uses the great phrase autonoetic consciousness, which basically means self knowing awareness that’s what we mean by insight. This area of the brain essential for it. And making a mind sight map of you, I want to make a map of your mind, what you’re feeling, what you’re thinking, what are you going through, what’s it like to be you, in your shoes, that’s empathy. A mind sight map of you. Morality would be a mind side map of we, what’s the larger social good here. And then these nine are outcomes of the middle prefrontal cortex eight of the nine improved in tuition gaining access to the side of the body has just never been studied in attachment research. Amazingly all nine of these are proven outcomes of mindfulness training and some of the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn and Richy Davidson. Why would that be, why would a functioning of this part of the brain, number one, secure attachment, eight of nine are these number two, mindfulness sitting on a cushion and practicing meditation number three. And if I asked you, how many on this list would you want to be a function of effective psychotherapy, most therapists sees hundred thousand of that, say yeah, this is the list of what I want is good outcome of psychotherapy. And so mental health. Then you look at wisdom studies, you know a lot of these would come out on what it means to be wise person and one-time I was lecturing in Alaska, and subsequently happen in other areas too, and a leader of the Inuit tribes in the Northern Alaskan islands came to me and said you know what that list is, I said what? She said for the last five thousand years, in the old tradition, that list is what our people of passing down of little wise and kind life. And since then people in the Cota tradition, the Polynesian tradition, the Hindu tradition, the Buddha tradition this list seems to embrace what wisdom traditions have been teaching for thousands of years. What’s going on here? Is this just a coincidence? Or is there something fundamentally shared in wisdom traditions, mental health, secure attachment, mindfulness and integrative functioning. And I want to suggest you that integration is the heart of all those human experiences. In fact integration made visible is kindness and compassion. So where does this leave us? You know, we’re going to end this and have time for questions now. You know David Rock a colleague of mine in the organizational world and I were thinking how could to just make stuff like this, like available? You know, how could you say, what should people do in schools or in organizations where David works in, and we said well, they were coming out with their new suggestion of what you should eat in the form of a platters that have a pyramid they are making a platter. So we said, what about our mind platter healthy mind platter that tells you to make optimal brain matter. So basically this is what you know, but it's a fun way that David and I want to make a visual, which is about the importance of taking time every day is like how do you feed your mind every day. Sleep time, reminds you to sleep well, as we talked about. Physical time, we talked about that too, aerobic exercise, and exercising keep your body moving. Focus time is close paying of attention. We’ve talked about all these, but just reminds you, if you’re in a classroom, this is what you need to do. Connecting time, talk about the importance of relationships and I try to remember this by 3g2p, coming with gratitude, with generosity and even with a sense of gifting or giving back to people and the planet. 3g2p is how I remember it. That’s connecting time be out in nature. Connect with people. Play time is the idea of having fun, this is the novelty piece, we also have talked about that, right, to be playful to be humorous, to be enjoying yourself, not to be focusing on a game and that’s all grade, but that’s a different kind of time. This is the time where it's spontaneous, there is no right or wrong, it's not competitive it's shear spontaneous, emergence of humor and fun and allowing people to just goof around. I need to do more of that. The play time is very important. Downtime, is time to just relax and don’t do anything. Just hang out as we have this person reading a book, just chilling out and that’s very important and it also all of these things help the brain grow. And then time in which should have a dash there, time in is the phrase I created just to remind ourselves hey every day you need to look in to reflect inward and reflection and relationships help to develop resilience these new three hours of education I’m trying to inspire educators to embrace not just reading, writing arithmetic, but reflection which is the time in, relationships and the resilience that we're going to help kids develop. So time in is just taking some time to reflect the inwardly to create a space in the mind so you develop those nine middle prefrontal functions. So together we now work with our clients and patients in all the different settings you work with them, individually, groups, couples, families wherever you’re doing your work, but you can take it beyond the therapy suite, so that you can actually promote healthy growth of integrative fibers in the brain for everyone in our community. Thanks so much for sharing and we have time for questions now. And here they come. Let me begin with the question from now and then I’ll go from the questions before. So from Chris, there is a question, does neurogenesis occur throughout the brain or just in one or two areas? Well, excellent question. The work of Rusty Gage I love his name at the Salk Institute and I think he might be, yeah I think he is still there. And another people of UC Irvine suggest that what we can say for sure is that neurogenesis stem cells developing into fully grown neurons happens in the hippocampus, but keep in mind that the hippocampus has an integrative area may be the source of the stem cells, but the hippocampus is connecting widely separated areas together to create explicit memory. So it's not just that the neuron stays and it's little origin in the dentate drivers of the hippocampus, but it's going to grow connections distributed throughout especially the cortex. So I hope that helps Chris, this is the idea that neurogenesis starts with the stem cell, which we’ve only identified in the hippocampus, but then the hippocampus as an integrative region goes out to far areas. So neurogenesis impacts the integration of the whole brain. Okay and let’s go on to some other questions. Here is a question from our attachment work and I wait for other questions on neuroplasticity. Is there any evidence that neuro feedback is a useful tool in the integration of the nervous system leading to greater coherence of the adult narrative? Now there is work by some people in Massachusetts exactly talking about that and I gave a key note recently to the International Neurofeedback Society and I told them look, I refer people from neurofeedback, but I don’t do it and my trainers I don’t know about it, and I gave my presentation about integration and they said you know everything about neurofeedback, that’s exactly what we are doing, we’re constantly trying to integrate the brain. So I can only quote them or paraphrase them that they think it is a useful tool for integration. They have told me direct when I asked them this exact question. Yes, they feel like, everything that neurofeedback is about, is improving self regulation and the focus of attention, which is a part of regulation, by increasing integration. That’s what they’ve told me. That’s I can only what they said. I know one person in Massachusetts who has actually done an informal study showing that when she does neurofeedback the Adult Attachment Interview gets more coherence, but I haven’t seen a controlled study of that. So I don’t know, but it would make sense I know that in EMDR, which also I believe works at the level of neural integration, people will emerge with incredibly coherent narratives and the senses of self where I believe the coherence, emerges from integration and in EMDR, you’re not kind of going through systematic stuff, you're actually allowing people to get into these, states that I do believe integrate things left and right, and up and down. And I’ve seen in my own practice that coherent narratives emerge much more rapidly when you’re using an integrative process. Okay, and then there is a question about a specific program, which I’m not familiar with, for trauma so I can’t address that. Let’s go into the next one. Let’s see, do I think applying Adult Attachment Interviews to therapists would help integrating narratives for the therapist and/or predict the integration of the patients they are working with. It's a great question, there is an empirical study that has been done on this very question that looks at the therapist state of mind with respect to attachment. I believe I was using the AAI, but it may have been another measure that’s a little less expensive. And what they found was exactly what you’re saying. They don’t use the concept of integration, but they do use the idea of positive impact. Connection with the therapist ability to have a positive outcome to psychotherapy. There is fantastic meta-analysis don by John Norcross, a wonderful researcher in the field of psychotherapy research and what Norcross has found is that the capacity to be present and empathic with your client, the capacity to be open to feedback and to seek feedback to know what we’re doing this, is this gone well, is this okay? Should be change it this way, change it that way, those features are the best predictors of the outcome and what I present at the John and his written on the cover of the mindful therapist, but was basically taking his magnificent formulations and then saying what’s the neurobiology of that and in the mindful therapist you’ll see details of that in our whole book. That helps you yourself develop those features that would support exactly what John Norcross has establish as the key elements of effective psychotherapy. I think they’re integrative, I think they’re related to being present, which is one component of mindfulness, which is why, I think mindfulness and why the book is called the mindful therapist is a very important aspect of fundamental training because it's a way we integrate ourselves from the inside out. Thank you for that question. Now the next question from Mali is, how could one go about becoming proficient in Adult Attachment Interviewing. What books courses et cetera would one need? Okay, great. Great question. First of all, the Adult Attachment Interview is a wonderful research instrument. I was trained in it by Mary Main back in 1990 and in 1991 or 1992 house on a panel with the Society for Research and Child Development with Mary Main and Mary Ainsworth and others. And the proposition was made that should the AAI be available for clinicians like pediatricians or psychotherapies. And the position from the attachment world was absolutely not. So this was now, decades ago. Just recently as I mentioned Mary Main and I with Erik Hesse presented a two-day conference and at the end of the conference, Mary Main beautifully said as we’re kind of reflecting on our feelings for the audience that she felt this was a very momentous time for her that she was giving her professional approval for the first time to offer the Adult Attachment Interview for clinicians to use. And the silence in the room when she, the originator of the AAI said that was just piercing and just so moving. So how do you do that? Is your question. So at one end let’s just say this, if you want to become a researcher in the AAI there are fantastic trainings and I would call the UC Berkeley Psychology Department and ask to get in touch with either Eric Hesse and that’s Mary Main's colleague and husband and/or Mary Main herself and at UC Berkeley they will let you know, how to actually get in touch I know if it's a website or connection through UC Berkeley's Psyche Department with the programs that exist around the world to be trained in a two week training program to become a researcher in the AAI. Now some times individuals do clinical applications I’ve done that with Mary and Eric and will see, available that would be for distribution, but there are opportunities learn clinically better or hopefully going to become available. What are the books you could read? Parenting from the inside out, would be a straight for way to begin your reading. The developing mind would be a good scientific backup, the mind sight book shows you how to apply the AAI in clinical practice the mindful therapies book gives you the AAI yourself as a person, so if you want to do it yourself, you can do it. And then the whole book is wrapped around you’re integrating yourself. There is a fantastic book called, clinical implications or applications of the Adult Attachment Interview and there is a name that’s appearing in my mind, but I don’t think it's accurate. So please look at up it's from Guilford Press I think it's 2007 or something like that. And there is an S in the name, but the name is coming to me I think it's wrong. So I’m having a hipocampo challenge at this moment. So I can’t come up with exact name. But that would be Steel, Mariam and Harvard Steel and they are the authors, the editors of that beautiful book. So that’s the clinical applications of the Adult Attachment Interview. If you really love the attachment work, this wouldn’t be so much how to learn the clinical applications of it, but I would look at the Handbook of Attachment by Guilford Press I think that came out second edition 2011 I believe and you could also check into, well I don’t think they use the Adult Attachment Interview, but they do wonderful work, the reflective parenting group here in Los Angeles builds on the work of Arietta Slade in New York, who’s done some fantastic work and anything by Arietta Slade or Mary Dozier would be excellent among many other people there is a lot of people I mean people out. But there are lots of people who do work the meta-analysis you might want to read or buy Marinus van IJzendoorn and Marian Bakermans-Kranenburg and so if you just look at the developing mind, looking the references you’ll see IJzendoorn is IZJ I can even remember this, if they are IZJ or IJZ, Endoorn. So Marinus and then Marian have written beautiful meta-analysis of thousands of studies, thousands of individuals have been studied with the AAI great, great great stuff and of course anything by Mary Main and Eric Hesse. So you said what books I would do. If you do come online with us, we have an extensive way of training people in interpersonal neurobiology and a big thing that we do is the Adult Attachment Interview and you’ll see me role model different interviews and how to use as a assessment of degrees of integration and how to create treatment planning. So please join us online if you go to either drdansiegel.com or mindsightinstitute.com you’ll find your way to the online courses and then you’ll join us for really a deep analysis of the clinical applications of all this material including attachment theory and the Adult Attachment Interview in particular. Okay, and then of course is the Pocket Guide to Interpersonal Neurobiology, which gives you that as well. The final question for today, from Brian. And thank you all for these great questions? Dan, thank you. Thank you. Let’s see, I’m working in unrelated field, but have stumbled upon your spectacular work, thank you Brian and begun integrating into my business. Wonderful. I’m in wealth management and our focus is working with individuals and families that are experiencing transition. As you know money changes life and life changes money. Yes, and the lack of money certainly changes life too. This puts me in unique position, this significant life money change seems to compound lives, unresolved issues I’m curious how to proactively address and stress immaculate our clients to prepare for the inevitable life money changes ahead any thoughts guidance. One thing I’d recommend Brian and if you haven’t done it, if you go to my website the drdansiegel website we have free resources and if you go to the resources section, they are literally mind sight training skills that you can download on to your digital object. And it will teach you basic capacities to stabilize how you’re sensing in a world reduce the classic breath awareness, but then we do something called the wheel of awareness. And we’re going to talk about it a lot in the next section of this course, but in the wheel of awareness, what you see is this capacity that really take our exploration of the mind and cultivate a resilient mind. And so it's really accessible it's based on integrating consciousness and I would give it a try because it's something that you can have your clients due. And I would love to get your feedback about if it gave them a sense of stability and clarity that allow them the do with life changes use with my focus and clarity in their lives that will be great to know. So thank you all so much for these great questions I look forward to see you in our next installment when we really look at neural integration and how to promote integration across many domains in psychotherapy. Thanks a lot for being with me.
