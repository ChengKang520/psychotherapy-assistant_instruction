UNAUTHORIZED REPRODUCTION OF THIS MATERIAL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BY ANY MEANS, IS LEGALLY PROHIBITED TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents LEARNING & TEACHING THERAPY with JAY HALEY a film series by JAY HALEY and MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY COMPULSORY THERAPY A VIOLENT CASE 

00:00:45
JAY HALEY This is one of a series of training films on Learning and Teaching Therapy. It is unique perhaps and that the clients are not shown nor are they heard. This is for reasons of confidentiality and the protection of privacy. What it's presided is the planning and carrying out of therapy by a supervisor and a training group. It shows a supervisor at work and the trainees expanding their ideas and skills hopefully. The goal is to change therapists as well as to change clients, since they must learn how to change people in distress. The films offer valuable material for discussion since ideas differ about how to do therapy and how to train. The therapy being taught is brief and problem focused and the trainees have not been taught the particular approach. The supervision is live with the trainees watching from behind a one-way mirror and taking turns going into do therapy. Suggestions from the supervisor to the therapist are sent to a computer monitor in the therapy room. The therapist can see the messages sent on the monitor, but the clients cannot. 

00:01:55
Let us now… 

00:01:55
Planning the First Interview 

00:02:00
JAY HALEY Let's discuss. Tell me something about what you know about. 

00:02:05
What I know about the, the case is that, that he got in um, the two sons evidently were walking down the street somebody a neighbor kid yelled some profanities at 'em, some racial slurs and the two kids proceeded to be kid up and the father pressed charges which got them into the probation system, juvenile probation system and this is mandated counseling for them to have to come here for the whole family is supposed to come. That's what they say at least one parent and at least the two kids that got in trouble. 

00:02:40
JAY HALEY And these are the two kids meet up with the other kids. 

00:02:45
Supposedly yes, that's supposed to be the way it is, hopefully that's the way it is, that uh, there is a new policy that if anybody pressed the charge they automatically have to go to all these loops and jumps. Just like it's a way to, it's going to almost like an extreme now like if any kid brings any sort of a knife on compass are automatically expelled. Uh, even if it's you know a little that hangs up a key chain where that's kind of what the courts are doing with this now. Any type of violence whatsoever that putting them through this, you know this big process and things. 

00:03:20
JAY HALEY Well, he hit some kid and then they the court people or the police is only (inaudible ) down. 

00:03:25
That's what happened they thought the kid both hit him then kicked him and then hit him again and um, and then the police got involved when the kid went and told his father, the father tracked them down, the fathers who pressed charges. The child who got the, the kid who got the, his fathers wouldn't press(ph) charges and said that I want something done about this and that's when they do that. That's what (inaudible ) involved. 

00:03:50
JAY HALEY This is a compulsory family therapy case, the court has reacted to the boy's fighting by ordering them to probation, community service to group therapy for anger management and for family counseling. Hopefully, all the helpers agree with each other. There are two parents in the home, but the father is often traveling out of town. This leaves mother in-charge of six sons. The father was not at home when this violence occurred. At this time he is at home and has expected for the family interviews. The family is from the Pacific Islands. 

00:04:25
JAY HALEY What are you concerned about? 

00:04:30
One of the concerns is, is there really a problem, so the kids beat up another kid, does that mean that they should be and where they are at in regards to um, should they be in the system like they are for that and that's something I want to find out, you know. If there is, I'm also concerned that there is going to be no family problems, you know we will see, but that's not sure how I have the records to be with spin out racial slurs to me too. 

00:04:55
JAY HALEY That's right. 

00:04:55
I might have felt somebody do. So… 

00:05:00
JAY HALEY The external (inaudible ) 

00:05:02
Yeah. No, I'm gonna start mutual and just try to find out what's going on. 

00:05:10
JAY HALEY And, and who, who is here one of the two boys? 

00:05:15
Yes, that's as far as I understand. 

00:05:15
JAY HALEY Is there a father (inaudible )? 

00:05:19
The father yes, and that's what I would like to try to get in eventually I asked about him, he told he can't make it he works three jobs, you know constantly busy, I'm gonna address that and find out what it will take to get them in. 

00:05:30
JAY HALEY Can you find out who, who decides when the therapy goes? 

00:05:35
For them or for me? 

00:05:40
JAY HALEY For them. 

00:05:40
Okay. 

00:05:40
JAY HALEY There must be, according to him but its okay. 

00:05:45
I decide. 

00:05:45
JAY HALEY You decide and then the court goes by what you say? 

00:05:45
Exactly. Exactly, this probation officer have something(ph) as 500 cases that he used to (inaudible ) on my recommendation or keep it open comparing it on what I say. 

00:06:00
JAY HALEY Okay. 

00:06:00
And I do have the power if they don't show up or, or not complying with counseling to turn that in and they will go straight to juvenile home, the kids will. 

00:06:10
JAY HALEY If they don't go, come to counseling would you say… 

00:06:10
And, and they are not compliant exactly. So that's like a big… 

00:06:15
JAY HALEY And they know that? 

00:06:15
Uh, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. 

00:06:20
JAY HALEY I think at some point you would rather say you (inaudible ) that you have so much responsibility in this situation and that you decide what happens with, I would say you want to be absolutely fair with them. That as you can put it like it's a problem of yours, which it is as a matter of fact. 

00:06:35
Yes, it is. 

00:06:40
JAY HALEY And then they will have usually when families like this come in they don't have any idea of what they are here for. The details of this situation who has power over what they often don't know. So it's best to clarify that one. 

00:06:55
Okay. 

00:06:55
JAY HALEY You, you haven't got supervisor with this magic machine over here. 

00:07:00
Not yet. 

00:07:05
JAY HALEY And we don't have time to practice it, but all things try something like ask the mother about the father and if there is anything to ask the mother about the father if you agree with it, if you don't agree then (inaudible ). 

00:07:21
Okay. 

00:07:21
JAY HALEY Well, if it's, it really a fine amount of touch then you, then you come out. 

00:07:25
Okay. 

00:07:25
JAY HALEY Just to cure some (inaudible ) discuss it get in, get in line and then go back again… 

00:07:30
Okay. 

00:07:35
JAY HALEY I would like to do, do (inaudible ) would do it. If you don't try to do which you think I want to do till I tell you what to do. 

00:07:40
Okay. 

00:07:45
JAY HALEY Just do what you would do and maybe I will never call him. If you are doing fine I will just watch. 

00:07:50
Okay. 

00:07:50
JAY HALEY We will all just watch it as a matter of fact. 

00:07:55
[sil.] 

00:08:05
So after you nailed them you went down and then you jumped in and you kicked in the mouth. So which we are actually not up to. 

00:08:15
And what is going on with your case? Why you guys here? 

00:08:20
JAY HALEY This interview focused on to finding the problem. The mother came with the two boys and the father did not appear. Both mother and boys were quite responding only when spoken to. The boys spoke little and sat with their heads down. This reluctance to talk is often what happens in compulsory therapy. The family behaves as if they don't want to be there and soon the therapist feels the same way. It is important to explore hierarchy in the family particularly when there is violence. 

00:08:55
And what are the rules and you said those in the rules uh, how do you think, what do you think about it. 

00:09:00
These Directives Explore Hierarchy 

00:09:05
What, and what about dad get in here? What's the possibility of get him here, because I want to get this perspective on this too. 

00:09:10
JAY HALEY Okay, having(ph) got the truth you should complement. 

00:09:15
Discussing the First Interview 

00:09:15
Just keep raising. 

00:09:15
JAY HALEY Because whatever you could do, you have to find something that they did well, but you could see her change, what she doesn't know why she is here, what it's for. Isn't to show she is a bad mother. It's just to show she is just treated her children or whatever. 

00:09:35
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:35
JAY HALEY So when you counted that you will get a complement about being a single mother with so many kids. It changes everything and rather (inaudible ), you know another way to put it if you want them to come up with something is to say that there is problems that you can solve and there is problems you will find the (inaudible ) off and my job is to help you with probably to counsel to eliminate the day-to-day living problem. 

00:10:00
Woo, that's a good thing. 

00:10:05
JAY HALEY But I thought that went well. 

00:10:10
It was so easy, it was so easy to get ideas and direct us to what to do, just glance over and say it was like perfect, it was perfect… 

00:10:15
JAY HALEY But you don't (inaudible ) what you're gonna do. 

00:10:20
Yeah, ha ha ha… I will try and make it fast, so I didn't look like I was staring at them… 

00:10:25
JAY HALEY It requires me making a very short sentence together… 

00:10:30
You guys (inaudible ). 

00:10:32
JAY HALEY You can't (inaudible ) as you can with a telephone, where you could say well (inaudible ) but we would have done it different. 

00:10:40
Well, I had one thought as to where like he is a little bit safe man (inaudible ) against. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
Well, I'm sure they might have great times amongst themselves. 

00:10:55
You got to get dad in for next time to find out being that he is daddy's boy how is going to react when dad comes into the room and see what happens. 

00:11:00
JAY HALEY That's why I think it will be good to have everybody. 

00:11:05
No, yeah I was standing there and that you put that (inaudible ) like I did, I was thinking (inaudible ) I want try to fit eight people in this room. 

00:11:11
JAY HALEY We will ask (inaudible ) come someday. 

00:11:15
I was asking what my (inaudible ) my frustration or my concern or I wonder (inaudible ) is input as to where it go from here with them as to I'm gonna see what they bring back next week to see if they think about what I, what I talked about and come back with a problem or come back with something they want to work on and use this time for when I felt like I thought… 

00:11:40
JAY HALEY Now, what happened when you within like we should have discussed making (inaudible ) if we knew these kids and knew the problems, but without that you could only probe and begin to get it formulated as even with results, which is I think difficult for some families like this, we're just want to be instructed what to do and where to go, so they don't like to spend their time improvising which I have to improvising if we don't know for sure where you are going with it. 

00:12:10
Oh, get me a plan(ph) then. 

00:12:15
Yeah, you did a great job. 

00:12:15
Actually you did very well. 

00:12:15
We were amazed at how well you were able to use every single, good report… 

00:12:20
You looked relaxed. You looked relaxed. You, you used humor… 

00:12:25
I just try to forget that he was here and just acted like that he wasn't there. 

00:12:30
JAY HALEY But it would help us saying to me that several times I spend (inaudible ) when you began to do the thing but I thought that was well, and I think if you bring it more together that's the most therapeutic thing you can do some of this particular crime, because you are gonna have grown up boys and a father and a mother. 

00:12:50
Yeah. 

00:12:50
JAY HALEY You found about your limits I (inaudible ) I mean what you are allowed to do and not to do. 

00:12:55
What's that? 

00:12:55
JAY HALEY Can you try and (inaudible ) that you just (inaudible ) them. 

00:13:01
Yeah. 

00:13:01
JAY HALEY Because after the big session if it goes well and achievable. 

00:13:05
That's one thing. that's why you know like, that's why I kind of put it out there that you think they are mandated (inaudible ) they have to come and (inaudible ) and I kind of put there say, I had the power to make this shorter and we could address the problems hoping that that would kind of go oh, we are great, well I will just go and solve this problem out there at least to get something going hoping to have louvered and then with. 

00:13:25
JAY HALEY Nice, and let's put the other eight sessions in the bank and if you get into trouble you got to come back to the bank. 

00:13:35
Alright. 

00:13:35
JAY HALEY But you are given a feeling then say I would (inaudible ) or whatever, whatever is left and then make sure everything perfect. So they, they know you are in the picture. 

00:13:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:50
JAY HALEY And it applies to forcing the picture. Okay, well we are running into the next one. Okay, that's about it. 

00:13:55
Great, thanks. 

00:13:55
Good. 

00:14:00
And I hope for (inaudible ). 

00:14:01
Second Interview Expecting Father 

00:14:01
And I ask him questions about how he reacted when he heard the news of the fight, what he did about it. um, how you (inaudible ) handed, support that relationship about supporting hopefully, he feels that mom is doing a good job and you know, get some strokes for her out of that and also try to reinforce his, his role as dad in this situation it is to. 

00:14:30
JAY HALEY Well, it must be difficult (inaudible ). 

00:14:32
He has to do what it is exactly, exactly. And what's that like for him. 

00:14:35
JAY HALEY Because I would put the framework as we do that's why they are here. 

00:14:40
Yeah. 

00:14:40
JAY HALEY And so you have to explain it to some extent. 

00:14:45
Yes. okay. 

00:14:50
That's so exciting. 

00:14:55
Observing the Second Interview 

00:15:00
[sil.] 

00:15:15
JAY HALEY The mother focused on the family rules for the two boys. The father did not appear and was said to be working. 

00:15:20
Yeah, but then it looks like it took the other way that… 

00:15:25
Um, I would like to see that mom. (inaudible ). 

00:15:35
JAY HALEY And you got to figure out how to do it. 

00:15:40
(inaudible ). 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:45
Discussing the Second Interview 

00:15:55
I don't think that I'm not picking up a problem and… 

00:16:00
JAY HALEY There is not any strange behavior though. 

00:16:00
No, that's what I was looking for, I was looking for some kind of a oblige, somewhere in what they were answering or something that I can pick on and the only thing I got so far is (inaudible ) to test that out and you know, I didn't you know, mom saying you know, what he told me to do this. You know, with the kids as to he says you fix up and it (inaudible ). 

00:16:24
JAY HALEY Well, that's a part of his life. 

00:16:25
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:25
JAY HALEY You know, when I was handling family classes I gather Scandinavian paper on the same (inaudible ) and what it is as he goes out for six months and then he comes back and he wants to take over the family and the wife is going organize in her way and it getting real (inaudible ) great relief he went back to see again. 

00:16:45
Well, that's what we are trying to ask to see if what… 

00:16:45
We are trying to ask to see if there was any kind of that in there like what's the difference between when you see her or versus when he is gone and when he comes back is there any kind of fears(ph) or anything that happened and you can also see (inaudible ) it's gone you know, something it's function in the same way, aren't they great. 

00:17:00
It sounds like culturally they just adhere to the, the hierarchies. 

00:17:05
That's yeah. 

00:17:10
Dad comes on he is the boss, he leaves mom is boss. 

00:17:10
Yeah. 

00:17:10
Do you think you are cured? 

00:17:15
Would you think about the question, so they are cured? 

00:17:15
Yeah, that was good, yeah. 

00:17:15
That's a good question I like that question, yeah. 

00:17:20
Alright. 

00:17:20
Yeah. 

00:17:20
Although you know, it's, it's an interesting question, because it really depends on the culture you are dealing with so when you talking about the issue of a curer, I think it means different things for different cultures. 

00:17:30
JAY HALEY Oh yeah, whether it is a matter for the people thinking about what are you gonna around which keeps you focused on the problem, which is what you won't really. I think it only go into her parent and if there was some evidence of that was related to these kids going wild or something. You didn't seem to be (inaudible ). 

00:17:51
I'm not finding that, I mean good grades, they seem to be respectful of not fighting that much amongst each other. Um… six… 

00:17:55
JAY HALEY And you are doing very well to fill the time. 

00:18:00
I did appreciate as much as you guys wanted to type and I was like come on give me some more to keep me going did you guys want me to explore some other place. I give you, you started typing like oh good, here we got… its kind of (inaudible ) wait for to pop up and go from there, but yeah I felt like I had to go 45 minutes worth of time. 

00:18:20
JAY HALEY I think a lot of compulsory therapy cases are like that as they have to see you and at the time solve the problem and you have to go on saying you… because there has to be ten sessions and what do you do? 

00:18:30
Exactly, the throng maybe a class(ph) or you know induced of I mean you know… 

00:18:40
JAY HALEY Problems are out there. 

00:18:40
Yeah. 

00:18:40
JAY HALEY Battered each other turn around. 

00:18:45
Yeah, those two big boys and somewhat it sounds like the ones you got you have been younger, it's just the same size. The girls are as to take us to sit, I wouldn't doubt it. 

00:18:55
JAY HALEY I think they got to be respect on the field. 

00:18:55
I think so. 

00:18:55
Did you know what was said that take them off, exactly what was said and… 

00:19:00
JAY HALEY What would you mean so? 

00:19:05
It was something racially, I don't know exactly what they said. 

00:19:10
We knew about when you asked that about being racial they didn't really sound… 

00:19:10
She didn't react to that. 

00:19:15
He felt dread and he felt that was going to get. 

00:19:15
He thought the guy was something like reminding that's why he turned around and popped him. 

00:19:20
I don't know that he even said anything. 

00:19:25
The racial slur was something they had secondhand if you remember somebody here, somebody else told them this guy had made some racial remarks and was taking about and they ran into this guy with his friends and some words were exchanged and then they left and they rather they came back and obviously were afraid that something was gong to happen and reacted. 

00:19:50
My whole sense of the kid is that they were very warm and open and friendly. I didn't get the sense that they were… that they have violence streak through them. 

00:20:00
JAY HALEY Usually, you could feel in the room if they do. 

00:20:00
I do not sense… 

00:20:00
JAY HALEY They let you know of what they do. I'm probably planning to bring in. 

00:20:05
We even suggest that. 

00:20:10
JAY HALEY That's one percent only… 

00:20:10
Okay, well I could ha…ha…ha… that's what I was going to do. 

00:20:15
What about mom? 

00:20:15
JAY HALEY If you do just with them you're dealing with him, the man about raising kids and protecting you won't sound so much. If you see… 

00:20:25
Absolutely. 

00:20:25
JAY HALEY If you see them with the two boys, then you get an idea of him ignoring his authority whether to avoid this as well as the mother does. 

00:20:35
I would like to get them all, I would like to bring them all here and then as the session goes on if I need to ask so and so to leave and you stay and go from there. 

00:20:45
JAY HALEY You got the kids out very nicely here I thought though, you always… you bothered at home. 

00:20:50
So just how it be the three boys? 

00:20:55
JAY HALEY I am, I am leaning toward this man, I think they wanted… could be stay out of it. 

00:20:55
Okay. 

00:21:00
JAY HALEY He has some relationship with those boys independent where I am sure. 

00:21:00
Okay. 

00:21:00
JAY HALEY And if, and if you see her with them they are just sent to a parent and together I think, you lure some moment. By nurses(ph) if man thinks that he got somebody like a mom. 

00:21:15
Let somebody feel like that, he is proud. 

00:21:15
JAY HALEY But it could be done with the father alone. 

00:21:20
I would like to do kind of the same thing I did here we had it both. See the interaction that goes on between the three of them, and see that how it get established, see how they react to dad's response and how dad responds to them and then may be talk to dad alone afterwards, kind of the same type with the kids out of the room. 

00:21:40
Also make it a part of the contingency of the… of their treatment in order to satisfy the need of he court and um… 

00:21:50
JAY HALEY Let us all think they had some compulsory therapy. 

00:21:50
Third Interview Expecting father 

00:21:50
Exactly, now if the whole family shows up, I think all eight them, then I might do all eight just to see what that eight from there I want to explore with dad a lot about what the world is like for him. I want to know what it was like for him when he found out what the boys and dad how did he react. 

00:22:10
JAY HALEY Sure… 

00:22:10
Um… I will find out… um… 

00:22:15
JAY HALEY I would do that in the framework of not happening again. I mean what alternatives should they have used or whatever you know. 

00:22:25
Okay make it so they won't happen again in that kind of framework. I want to find out what it's like for him to be away as much as he is from the family and what kind of effect that has on him. If that has any kind of effect. 

00:22:40
JAY HALEY If it's related to the boys problem. 

00:22:40
Exactly yeah. 

00:22:40
JAY HALEY Because there is lot of guys who may be worrying that much and the kids aren't really people of… but that sounds good. 

00:22:55
So that's kind of… 

00:22:55
JAY HALEY And if they all show… 

00:22:55
I don't know. 

00:23:00
JAY HALEY You could see him in parts or you could see him all again. The one thing you might do if they all show, you see them altogether and then decide, whether you want to talk to the father alone or not or father and mother alone. Because what they say about the kids, they might not say with the kids there. 

00:23:20
Hmm…hmm… It's true 

00:23:20
JAY HALEY And to get some idea of what conflict that was between mother and father it's often helpful to see them without the kids. If you're trying to pack a lot and do a very brief therapy, on the case where the problem can be that you… you find them having difficulty with life, like him make you(ph) way so much when that isn't the issue really unless its related to the violence in someway. 

00:23:50
Yeah that seems like we tie that in, and see if it is tied in, I think that way is much do you think that's… 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY If it's a special problem with him being away, the… in the sense that there may be a way he could to be on sure, his wife would like it too and he would rather not and then you're into a issue of conflict which may or may not be related to the boys. 

00:24:10
Observing the Third Interview 

00:24:15
JAY HALEY The father did not appear at the third interview. At this point it was becoming evident that his presence was going to be necessary. He appeared to be important in this family and they had trouble focusing upon the boys problem without the father there, the therapist came behind the mirror to discuss a plan. 

00:24:35
Fairly what you like to do is make the appearance that you can't close the case until you see the father again. 

00:24:40
Okay, so this might be a short session. 

00:24:45
And you can tell them this would be a short session. 

00:24:45
JAY HALEY He concluded that he could not advise the court about the case, without the father present. Mother told him to personally telephone the father, which he had not done and he did so. The father came in at the next interview. In the training group, there were differences of opinion about whether the boys would be violent again. It wasn't clear there were ethnic issues until the father came in. 

00:25:10
Discussing the Third Interview 

00:25:15
That guy was serious clam when came to saying anything about dad. 

00:25:15
JAY HALEY He sure was. 

00:25:20
We tired about something else. I am sure dad probably came down but they were trying to make dad in trouble. They said that dad whipped me, dad throw me into the wall or something I don't know. 

00:25:30
My husband would… my husband would you know say you know what don't bring the family. 

00:25:30
Right, so dad not gonna say any one. 

00:25:35
Not going to say. 

00:25:35
So, it a cultural thing. 

00:25:35
It's a cultural thing. Dad probably said next time this happens you're going to have to deal with me. Right now your mom is going to handle it, but next time you're going to deal with me and if their dad has to come down here, and deal with this these guys are in big trouble. But that's why he used to come down. 

00:25:50
Yeah let see if he comes down. You know… I got his phone number I will call up. 

00:25:55
I don't know may be there were some deception used by saying can't close the case up so I see dad but in the end I think that really is, I think it's that and trying to believe that. 

00:26:05
JAY HALEY That's, that's clinically good. 

00:26:05
I don't feel like it was, I don't feel like he was expectation, I said do you know I want to see dad before I close this case. I agree you know, I want to get that the last thing. 

00:26:15
I got a different view of what the problem was now, with this I didn't know, that let some adult tell him that another teenager was back melding being him so when he went home… 

00:26:30
Not expecting to went into this care, they granted this care and that small guy, because he killed the dog threw it back in his truck and had cans of gasoline outside the guy's house. So that guy pressed charges against the kid that they beat up the victim and now the victim is in jail because of that. 

00:26:55
Its been a hack of a year for the victim. 

00:26:55
So I think this goes around to what's really I notice from mom right away and this is probably what you're picking up is you're not picking up that there is remorseful, I think mom sees this as you know what I got good kids, we're a good family, here is this horrendous family over here and this is all was kind of a mistake. 

00:27:15
She wants to focus on that yeah. 

00:27:20
Yeah, but what I think is that this boy I mean there are just going to be other kids out there that are saying your mom… your mom is brown and he sucked his bother into this and now that he explains his behavior when he come here. He is really quiet. 

00:27:35
It seems unreal, unreal to me, to just we have to handle. It tells me that there is an awful lot of internal control the people are going to react to that I mean why wouldn't they then be concerned about driving age, I mean if this boy is driving if somebody just feels out in front of them I'm just for an example… 

00:27:55
I thought that was interesting. I thought he was telling… I thought he was very talented not that one that drives… 

00:28:00
But the point that I am trying to make is let's generalize it to any situation whether they are out in public and somebody gives them, cast a glance of them that they feel is jury or disrespectful. When are they going to be able to have some internal control to walk away from there or to ignore it. 

00:28:15
So that is that there is the experience that's given that internal control. 

00:28:20
JAY HALEY But they are also saying this is the first time this happened they have been pulled in before on this. 

00:28:25
But also what about the whole thing we said this is the only night you have ever been out in your life. This is the… 

00:28:30
JAY HALEY First time you have been out at the dark. 

00:28:35
I am curious what do you think about the beeper, there are kids that aren't driving. 

00:28:40
Let people… 

00:28:40
They take him out after six. 

00:28:40
Not supposedly they did not, they were in the islands, they were already driving like 13. So… and my boys got driver's license early and they were driving. So what do you think about the fact that there is supposedly end before six, there is kids where you know usually (inaudible ), and now is that a deeper what do you think about that? 

00:29:00
It's a little unbelievable to me. 

00:29:00
It does sound strange. But lots of this kind of cultural stuff, does sound strange. 

00:29:10
JAY HALEY So you just find out if father was embarrassed by what they did. We got a little information about him but not much about how father really reacted to this whole thing. 

00:29:20
And that every session how dad handled it, how he reacted and what he did? 

00:29:25
May be you can ask dad. 

00:29:25
That's what we are gonna do about ask dad, because a lot we can get out of him. Start with all four of them again. 

00:29:30
JAY HALEY I would start with all four of them sharing and speak to father first and the more you listen to father, the more power he has so that there is a kind of a laying on of hands of power if you pay more attention to father, than you do to mother, father will rise so it's not just gathering information that it's a structure in which you're laying hands on to give anybody, but if… if the father says I am just never here and then may be how can I handle these problems, when I am worried so much then I will begin to shift having support mother handling this instead of him handling this. But it doesn't sound like these boys beat somebody up in relation to the family. It may be or may not. But they don't seem to and you have to make it clear whether you're an agent of the court or you are not an agent of the court really. On issues such as what would you reveal and what wouldn't you reveal and the ethical issues are very complex on that when it's… 

00:30:50
But I told them that I would report back and told them at the very beginning not in the session here but they we're filling out the forms in there… when I was describing the situation describing the environment. I told them that the only information I will give back to the court or back to the probation officer was whether they were compliant or not. 

00:31:10
JAY HALEY The clients tells you never decide who comes in, you should decide who comes in and some people make a big issue if the guy didn't show up they won't see the family that's it. And all the time you'll see one in the family and not the rest of them, so you to have the full flexibility. I think the mother, I think the mother will bring him in. 

00:31:30
Oh yeah, mother will bring him in. 

00:31:30
JAY HALEY Once she saw she had to, she began to isolate it's a bit(ph)… they will do it again or something like it. So that maybe after this terminate we should make him bet and do a six month follow up and people had to put their money on the line. 

00:31:50
I don't think they will do it again. 

00:31:50
I don't think. 

00:31:55
JAY HALEY Well, you had to make the bet. 

00:31:55
They'll just how did they won't get caught next time. 

00:32:00
JAY HALEY Well that we won't know? 

00:32:00
Yeah, I don't think they will do it. 

00:32:05
I think they will do it again. 

00:32:05
Fourth interview father Arrives 

00:32:10
Basically we talked about so far is explaining to dad what was, what this whole get up was about, what my position is with the court so. And his reaction to… to the incident and how do you felt about it and so forth from there. Said about, so much things. Did I leave anything else? 

00:32:35
No. 

00:32:40
JAY HALEY Did any of you handled this differently? One of those cases it might or might not be a case. 

00:32:50
That's true. 

00:32:50
Yeah. 

00:32:50
I don't think it was a case. I personally I don't think it was a case. 

00:32:55
Before they handle it well you know. 

00:33:00
These three solid sessions you were confirmed of your hypothesis. 

00:33:05
Yeah. 

00:33:05
JAY HALEY The relationship as a father and the boys was focused upon as it had been with mother and the boys. It had not been clear there were ethnic structures in the family until this point. Many of the possible explanations of the training group differed when cultural issues appeared. Rather than father being irresponsible for not coming to therapy, he proved to be the authority in the home with the wife secondary. He said he was deliberately not being involved with the court, because he was stepping aside, so his sons would feel the power of the law. He wanted them to feel fear and not be violent again. Rather than being an abusive father whom the boys feared he was embarrassed and hurt over the incident. When along with the therapist he wept, the shame of the boys reflected on the whole family and the father said his name was not respected rather than supporting the violence by defending their honor he had always taught the boys to walk away from gangbanging and cursing. The rules in the family proved to be quite strict. He and his wife required the boys to be in the dark and doing their homework. The father even wanted to apologize to the father in the other family but he learned the boy who was the victim was now in jail on another charge. The father arranged not to travel in the next two years, so that he would be home with his boys. He expressed the view of what happened by saying there is no such thing as a small wrong or a big wrong. Anything that will reflect on the name of my grandfather is embarrassing. I want the boys to grow up to be proud of themselves. The court dismissed the case when the therapist reported and in a six months follow up there had been no further violence. If the father had been considered only you're irresponsible and the case was mishandled, it could have been a misfortune to this respectable family. Could have been that step as the case and it would have dangerous end, they got mad or they refused to come and the girl will get down on them and would escalate those problems. 

00:35:25
Yeah and that would have been too bad.
