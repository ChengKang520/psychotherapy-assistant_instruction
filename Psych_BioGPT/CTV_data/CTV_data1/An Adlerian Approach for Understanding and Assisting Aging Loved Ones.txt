RADHA HORTON-PARKER Hi. I am Radha Horton-Parker. 

00:00:00
CHARLES FAWCETT And I am Charles Fawcett. 

00:00:05
RADHA HORTON-PARKER We look forward to spending some time with you today as we discuss important strategies and concepts for working with and caring for older adults. 

00:00:15
CHARLES FAWCETT But Radha, what if our viewers are planning on working with this population with the older adults? 

00:00:20
RADHA HORTON-PARKER That’s an excellent point, Charlie. They may not plan on being around older adults. Many of us don’t expect to do that or even to get old ourselves. 

00:00:30
CHARLES FAWCETT I know I am not planning on getting old. 

00:00:30
RADHA HORTON-PARKER I am not either, so I don’t know why these wrinkles have suddenly appeared. Actually most of us are surprised by aging. We don’t think it will happen to us or to our loved us. We think our lives will go on just as they are today and we’ll stay young forever. The truth is, however, if we are fortunate enough to live along time, we will age and so will those we love. 

00:00:55
CHARLES FAWCETT And we will be aging along. The elderly population is rapidly increasing. You’ve probably heard the phrase the Graying of America. Well, that’s exactly what is occurring as the baby boomers reach late adulthood. Just consider the 2001 statistics from the administration on aging. 

00:01:10
The Graying of America: 1 in 8 Americans is now 65 or older. 

00:01:15
CHARLES FAWCETT One in eight Americans is now 65 years or older. By the year 2030, older adults are expected to comprise over 30% of the U.S. population. The fastest growing age group in this country includes adults aged 85 and older. 

00:01:30
RADHA HORTON-PARKER So it perhaps(ph) all of us to be prepared to assist elderly individuals, as well as their caregivers who may be faced with tremendous stress. In fact, there is even a term the sandwich generation to refer to middle-aged adults who are caring for both their own children and their aging parents. Such person sometimes feels squeezed from both sides and are overwhelmed with responsibilities. Perhaps many of you are experiencing the stress of being caregivers for your own aging parents or other loved ones right now. If so, you know how demanding this can be. That’s why we created this video. In this presentation, we will share useful information about the characteristics and needs of older adults. We’ll also provide practical strategies for working with them and since we’re all getting older by the minute, let’s get started. 

00:02:30
Characteristics of Elderly Adults 

00:02:40
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Charlie, what images come to mind as you think of elderly individuals? 

00:02:45
CHARLES FAWCETT Umm… Well, I guess moving slowly, losing... hearing loss and perhaps eyesight, other health-related issues, sort of things. 

00:02:55
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, a lot of people think of those images. But are they accurate? Perhaps we should start by separating fact from fiction. 

00:03:00
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, let’s do so. Here are commonly held misconceptions about older adults, as well as some important facts. See if you can tell the difference. Number one, fact or fiction? Most elderly adults are in poor health and are unable to care for themselves. That’s fiction. Two-thirds of adults over 65 or older describe themselves of having good or excellent health and the number is expected to raise. Many older adults do, however, live with chronic health problems such as arthritis, high blood pressure, and diabetes and most experience some degree of hearing loss. Yet despite these conditions, most elderly adults live independently or they may find themselves relying on others for assistance with some household tasks. Okay, fact or fiction? Suicide rates are high among the elderly. If you guessed fact, that’s correct. About 3% of the people aged 65 or older experience clinical depression. Although that figure sounds kind of low, suicide rates are high in older adults than any other age group. Among the elderly, depression can be a serious problem. An untreated depression is associated with increased mortality. Yet depression often goes unidentified and untreated in older persons and then often love without the care that could save their lives. Okay, fact or fiction? In late adulthood, mental functioning rapidly declines, making olders senile unable to learn new skills. That’s actually fiction. Although fluid intelligence, the ability to take in and process new information declines with age, the crystallized intelligence, which is the accumulated knowledge-based upon past experiences continues to develop. So the increased crystallized intelligence helps to compensate for the loss of the fluid… the fluid intelligence ah… you know baring(ph) some kind of pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or some other medical problem. Older adults can continue to learn and act their new neurological connections in the brain. However, internal rhythms do slow down with age. So older adults require more time to process information and learn new skills. Fact or fiction? The elderly experience less satisfaction with life than younger people. Fiction. Surprisingly, studies show that aging doesn’t necessarily involve a decline in life satisfaction and subject of well-being. Although older persons must face the numerous changes and challanges associated with aging, they may not show diminished satisfaction with life. This may be because they have developed a broader perspective of life over the years and are able to feel good about their achievements through life. We should emphasize that having a positive mental attitude is associated with successful aging. Fact or fiction? Odler adulthood is a time of withdrawing from the world in order to engage in solitary contemplation of one’s inner experiences. That’s actually fiction. Excessive social isolation is associated with poor outcomes or staying involved with others is the key to successful aging. It is normal for older persons to withdraw from others at the very end of life as death approaches, but staying socially involved throughout most of late adulthood is correlated with greater longevity and higher quality of life. In fact a recent study by Howard Thomas Glass found that social engagement was as strong as anything in determining longevity and was even stronger than other factors such blood pressure, cholesterol, and other measures of health. 

00:06:45
RADHA HORTON-PARKER I’ve noticed some significant themes here. It appears that many of the negative images of aging such as poor health, overall mental decline, isolation, and dissatisfaction with life are just not accurate. Older adults have the potential to be healthy, mentally active, socially involved and to continue learning throughout life. 

00:07:10
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, they do. But there is also the potential for depression and isolation, which can put the elderly at risk. Also older adults move at a slower pace than younger people. For these reasons, it’s critically important for caregivers to be willing to take time to understand an aging person’s concerns and address them. 

00:07:30
RADHA HORTON-PARKER And that’s why we created this video. We want to create a greater awareness of the needs of older persons and to offer practical strategies for addressing them. More specifically, we want to help you better understand why problematic behaviors occur among the elderly. Using this knowledge, caregivers will be better able to resolve such situations. This will result in both improved quality of life for older persons and less stress for caregivers. 

00:08:00
CHARLES FAWCETT Now that we separated fact from fiction, let’s talk about working with older adults. 

00:08:10
Important Concepts for Working with Older Adults The Need to Belong 

00:08:20
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Charlie, before we begin this discussion, may I ask you a question? 

00:08:20
CHARLES FAWCETT Certainly. 

00:08:25
RADHA HORTON-PARKER What gives you your sense of identity? 

00:08:25
CHARLES FAWCETT Umm… that’s a good question. I guess it’s probably the roles that I have being a educator and researcher, as well as some of my relationships being a brother, a partner, a son, things like that. 

00:08:40
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, that’s how it is for most of us. The great psychologist Alfred Adler emphasized that we define ourselves and find meaning based upon our roles in life and how we fit in with others. 

00:08:50
"Social interest" = fitting into the social order 

00:08:55
RADHA HORTON-PARKER He used the term social interest to describe this human need to be a contributing member of a larger group. Adler stressed mental health depended upon fitting into and finding our own special place within the social order. By doing so, we achieve a sense of belonging and we feel that we count and have purpose. After all, we are not islands on to ourselves. And we all have the need to feel that we’re valued and appreciated within the human community. 

00:09:25
CHARLES FAWCETT And that doesn’t change no matter how old we are. 

00:09:25
The greatest human need is to belong. 

00:09:30
RADHA HORTON-PARKER No, it doesn’t. Regardless of age, we are still social beings and according to Adler the greatest of all human needs is to belong. In fact, studies have shown the connectedness is a fundamental human motivation and its absence has been associated with negative impacts on a number of factors such as health, adjustment, and well being. Therefore, it’s essential for individuals of all ages to feel that they belong and are connected to others even though their roles may change with age. In this video, we'll show how to use an Adlerian approach to conceptualize and work with issues that arise in caregiving for older adults. Although Adler and his colleague Rudolf Dreikurs originally developed many of these techniques for use with children, we’ll demonstrate how the concepts and strategies can work magnificently with the elderly. 

00:10:30
CHARLES FAWCETT That’s right. By using Adler’s theory, we'll show how you can understand and the motives and behaviors of older persons and then achieve productive solutions when problems arise so that everyone wins. 

00:10:45
Mistaken Goals 

00:10:55
RADHA HORTON-PARKER We’ve talked about the need to belong. Now let’s consider the concept of mistaken goals and how they can sometimes lead to erplexing behavior. According to Adler, all human behavior is goal-directed, purposeful and designed to meet the individual’s needs. As we said, one major need that we all have is to belong. Sometimes, however, if the person doesn’t know how to have his or her need for belonging met in productive ways, he or she may instead seek to achieve what Dreikurs call the four mistaken goals of behavior. The four mistaken goals of behavior are attention, power, revenge and assumed inadequacy. These mistaken goals lead to behaviors that might often be considered undesirable. For example, it’s not unusual to observe children engaging in an attention getting behaviors in the classroom such as making distracting noises or talking while the teacher is trying to get her... his or her points across. The children’s deeper need, however, is not for immediate attention but rather to feel that they belong and that they matter in the larger social order because they may not know how to gain acceptance through their achievements or may not perceive themselves as being valued members of the group. Such children choose the mistaken goal of eliciting undue attention often in annoying ways. In other words, they keep the teacher busy with them in order to have a role in the group. Although Adler and Dreikurs originally listed these as goals of children’s behavior, we'll show how they can also be used nderstand issues that arise with older adults, assuming that the need to belong remains critical throughout life. It’s easy to see how the mistaken goals could once again become relevant in the late adult years. Think about the many changes that occur in later adulthood. As adults grow older, they typically retire from their jobs, disengage from some of their roles they once played in the community and have to adjust to having different relationships with their own children who are now adult themselves. In fact, some senior citizens may find that they have to rely more on their children or others just to get by each day, so the roles become reversed. Consequently, these elderly adults may lose the prestige, power, attention and importance they once took for granted. To compensate, elderly adults may act out and listen ideal ways in an attempt to get their needs met, to feel that they still belong and that they still matter and that they still have a place in the social order. 

00:13:55
CHARLES FAWCETT But Radha you are not implying that the elderly are like children, are you? 

00:14:00
RADHA HORTON-PARKER No, far from it. But I am saying that older adults need to belong and to feel that they are still vital members of the social order, it never ends. If they reach a point at which they doubt that they are valued and needed by society, they may fall into the same patterns of mistaken goals introduced by Dreikurs. For example, older adults who have to move in with their adult children may long… may no longer feel in control of their own lives. They may doubt if they are still needed or valued. Their sense of belonging may be compromised and their behavior may begin to express the four mistaken goals that we listed. Throughout this video, we'll discuss mistaken goals and how they might be observed in the behavior of an older person. But before we discuss each mistaken goal individually, there are some important concepts that apply to all four. 

00:15:00
Mistaken goals are usually intended to achieve a sense of belonging. 

00:15:05
RADHA HORTON-PARKER First, we must remember that all behavior is purposeful and that mistaken goals are usually efforts by older persons to achieve a sense of belonging. If we think in terms of the older person’s needs rather than just his or her behaviors, we may find it much easier to have compassion. We can then… we can then more effectively address the root cause of any problematic behaviors. 

00:15:30
Use one's own feelings about the behavior to identify the mistaken goal. 

00:15:35
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Second, it’s important to identify, which mistaken goal the older person is attempting to achieve. One way to identify the mistaken goal is to consider how we feel when the older person’s behavior occurs. For example, if the mistaken goal was attention, we may feel annoyed. Another way to identify the mistaken goal is to think about what happens when we respond in the typical but often in effective way. Thus if the goal is attention, we may typically respond by giving the person still more attention even though it may sometimes be negative attention. Unfortunately, doing this often leads to the older person demanding even more attention. 

00:16:20
Understand the message that's being conveyed through the behavior. 

00:16:25
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Third, it’s important to understand the message that’s being conveyed through the mistaken goal. We'll show the different messages that are conveyed when we discuss each mistaken goal. Finally, we need to understand the notion of expectancy. When an older person is pursuing a mistaken goal, he or she expects a certain response to his or her behavior. The caregivers reaction often just feeds into the unproductive pattern and reinforces the problematic behavior. 

00:16:55
Refrain from responding to the behavior in the expected manner. 

00:17:00
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Therefore, paradoxically it’s usually better to do the opposite of what we feel most inclined to do. For example, if the older person is engaged in attention-seeking behavior, ignoring that behavior is often the most productive response. That’s why Dreikurs suggested that doing the opposite of our first impulse is often the best intervention and if that’s not possible, doing nothing is usually preferable to acting on our first impulse. 

00:17:35
CHARLES FAWCETT But is that because acting on our first impulse is usually the wrong thing to do? 

00:17:35
RADHA HORTON-PARKER That’s absolutely right, Charlie. Now let’s explore the four mistaken goals and some situations in which they can be observed in older adults. Before we proceed, however, please note that this video is designed to address the issues and needs of older persons who are mentally competent and not suffering from a pathological condition such as Alzheimer’s disease or maybe some other dementia. Although some of the strategies may work with adults who have slight mental impairments, our focus is on working with adults who are mentally sound. It would take another video to address the special needs of older persons who are mentally impaired. With that caveat in mind, Charlie why don’t you discuss the first mistaken goal? 

00:18:25
CHARLES FAWCETT Sure. I would be glad to. The first mistaken goal involves inappropriate attention-seeking. Parents or older adults may continually demand our attention as a way of assuring themselves that they are still important. On the one hand, they might ask (inaudible ) questions or request our help on projects or tasks that are completely capable of being performed by themselves. But on the other hand, they may enlist assistance with jobs that they really can’t do, but string them along, one after another, so as to require our constant attention as their caregivers. In either case, the older persons are getting more of our time than it’s actually required. Time which may, which may be in very limited supply. In short, their mistaken goal is seeking undue attention. 

00:19:10
RADHA HORTON-PARKER This might be a good time to introduce our viewers to Darla and Anne. 

00:19:15
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, it would be. Darla is a middle-aged woman who is married and has one son. Since the death of her father several years ago, Darla’s elderly mother Anne has lived alone and is mentally competent and except for some arthritis, is in generally good health and still keeps her own house, she cooks and drives short distances but avoid streets with heavy traffic. So to help out, Darla usually often comes by at least once a week to assist with store(ph), shopping, and anything else that her mother might need. Darla who is employed full time is finding it difficult however to balance the demands of her job, her own family with those of her mother. As a consequence, she is becoming extremely stressed and often dreads her weekly visits. In the following vineyard(ph) you will see how Darla’s mother Anne use attention as a mistaken goal. 

00:20:15
Attention Example 1 

00:20:15
DARLA Oh, okay, mom, I think I got it all done. 

00:20:20
ANNE Umm... 

00:20:20
DARLA Can you believe it? I’ve been here almost five hours, but I really do think I got everything done for you today. Let’s say, I went to the store and I got your head trimmers and I trimmed the edges. 

00:20:35
ANNE Hmm...Hmm... 

00:20:35
DARLA And I brought the window treatment you asked for me to get and I hung it. I think it looks nice, don’t you? 

00:20:40
ANNE Yes. 

00:20:40
DARLA Okay and also I got the flag pole bracket so that you can fly your flag now and I am all done with your list. 

00:20:50
ANNE Oh, honey, I appreciate that so much. But you know there is just one another thing. My tester isn’t working right. And do you think you could take a look at that? 

00:21:00
DARLA Well, mom, I don’t know how to fix a tester, but I can go get a new one. 

00:21:05
ANNE Well, I would appreciate that. 

00:21:10
DARLA Mom, I wish you had said something before I left for the first time. You know if I could have gotten everything done at one time, it would have been really nice. 

00:21:15
ANNE Oh, I am sorry! I just didn’t think about it. 

00:21:20
DARLA Okay, mom. I will be right back, it won’t be long. 

00:21:25
ANNE Okay. 

00:21:30
[sil.] 

00:21:35
DARLA Oh, see, mom, the traffic was horrible and the lane at the check out counter took for hour(ph). 

00:21:40
ANNE Umm…. 

00:21:40
DARLA But I got this tester and I think it will be okay. I think it’s what you need. You know what? I’ve got a million things that I need to do and the weekend’s almost over, so I’ve really got to go now, okay? 

00:21:55
ANNE No, I... I really appreciate this. 

00:21:55
DARLA Not a problem. 

00:21:55
ANNE But you know my telephone isn’t working right and it… it’s kind of a funny looking battery and do you have any of those here at the house and you know maybe you could just slip out and get me one before you go home, Darla? 

00:22:15
DARLA Mom, why didn’t you tell me this the second time that I went out? 

00:22:20
ANNE But I just didn’t think about Darla. 

00:22:25
DARLA Okay, mom. I'll go out again and I get you batteries. I'll be right back. I can’t believe she did this to me again. 

00:22:35
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Charlie, what do you think was going on with Anne? 

00:22:40
CHARLES FAWCETT She seemed to be stretching at the task that she keep Darla around as long as possible. Anne wanted her attention and that was one way to get it. Through her behavior Anne was saying, I only count when you are paying attention to me that was a means of achieving a sense of connection with her daughter. 

00:22:55
RADHA HORTON-PARKER So by giving Darla things to do, Anne was attempting to keep her involved in her life although not in a way that was very satisfying for Darla. 

00:23:05
CHARLES FAWCETT Oh, that’s right. That probably wasn’t very satisfying for either of them but at least as a way just for Anne to stay connected to Darla. Well, how do you think Darla felt when Anne asked her to do yet another task? 

00:23:15
RADHA HORTON-PARKER I'll bet she felt really annoyed and irritated. 

00:23:20
CHARLES FAWCETT Exactly. I would imagine she did and... and that’s very important. As we said, one of the best ways to figure out which are the four mistaken goals one is dealing with is to consider how the behavior makes us feel. If the mistaken goal is attention, we’ll feel probably feel annoyed or irritated just as Darla did. 

00:23:40
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, but although Darla felt annoyed by the behavior, she responded in a typical way by doing even more tasks for her mother. 

00:23:50
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes. although she was trying to be a good daughter, Darla annoyingly reinforced her mother’s demandingness. The more tasks she did, the more taskd Anne gave her. 

00:24:00
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes. She created a vicious cycle, but one which probably many of us probably experienced. So what could Darla have done instead? 

00:24:10
CHARLES FAWCETT Well, the most obvious choice would be for Darla to extricate herself from the problematic pattern and there are several ways that this could be done. One method might be to ignore her mother’s inappropriate attention-getting behavior and instead acknowledge appropriate behavior. 

00:24:25
RADHA HORTON-PARKER You mean by ignoring her mother’s request for Darla to do endless additional task and instead paying positive attention when Anne communicates more appropriately? 

00:24:35
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, exactly. Darla could praise her mother when Anne gives her a complete list of everything that needs to be done without tacking on extra items afterwards. In addition, Darla could choose to explain why she cannot do additional tasks because of other responsibilities she has by saying no she would avoid reinforcing Anne’s problematic behavior. When attention is the mistaken goal, it’s very important to avoid giving undue attention. Darla should give attention to her mom and attempt to meet her needs but only within workable parameters. For example, if Anne asked to run Aaron's(ph) midweek, Darla should suggest that she must wait otherwise she will end up becoming Anne servant. If Darla... Darla finds herself feeling annoyed or irritated, that might be a good indication that her mother is putting under demands on her. Darla can also avoid getting trapped to giving undue attention by establishing boundaries and maintaining a routine. 

00:25:30
RADHA HORTON-PARKER That’s right. it’s crucial to establish guidelines, set limits, and maintain boundaries with parents or older adults. This may involve taking them shopping twice a week, making house repairs once a month or having dinner with them once a week. Be clear about what you are willing and unwilling to do for them. Once it’s agreed upon, stick to it. You may even set time limit so that one-hour visits don’t turn into three-hour exercises in exasperation. Of course there may be occasional exceptions such as emergencies or unscheduled events. For example, you might choose to take your elderly parents with you to see their grandchild perform in a concert on a day you wouldn’t regularly visit them. This would however be your decision. 

00:26:20
CHARLES FAWCETT As with children, establishing a consistent routine allows older persons a sense of security in order. You can also help to alleviate anxiety in them. As the elderly become more dependent on others, having a set routine takes on a whole new level of meaning, because it relates to their survival, for example, on aging father who no longer drives won’t have to wonder when you're able to get his groceries because he will know that his diary(ph) will take him to the store on every Saturday. Having a routine also protects the caregiver from undue demands on his or her time. However, the caregiver must stick to the regular schedule and not come late, leave early or cancel the visit. If you occasionally need to change the schedule, be respectful. Call as early and advance as possible and negotiate another time. Habitually agreeing to take tasks that are outside the established boundaries shows a lack of respect for your parents, yourself and your own family. It's just that you don’t trust elderly person's ability to manage his or her life although it is edifying to please others and to be needed. As caregivers, we must have the courage to say no. If your parents become angry, try to be upset with him or her or with yourself. The next time you see the older person acts as if nothing negative has happened. In effect, nothing negative has happened, you are simply attempting to be truly effective and loving caregiver. 

00:27:45
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Another strategy that can be very helpful is that of logical consequences. Adler and Dreikurs believed that logical consequences were far more effective than punishment at changing behavior. Logical consequences allow the person to experience the result of his or her behavior rather than having to be disciplined arbitrarily by someone else. It’s important to note that logical consequences are not intended to be mean harsh or punitive. 

00:28:10
CHARLES FAWCETT Radha, what’s the difference between a natural consequence and a logical one? 

00:28:15
RADHA HORTON-PARKER That’s an excellent question, Charlie. A natural consequence is a direct result of our behavior. It’s not imposed by anyone else but instead occurs naturally as a result of our own actions. For example, if I touch a hot burner on my stove to see if it’s really getting hot and it is and I get burned that’s a natural consequence and I might add from personal experience, natural consequences are almost always effective at changing behavior. I don’t touch hot stoves anymore. A logical consequence on the other hand is a little different because it’s related to being a member of the social order and having to abide within the rules and parameters that go along with relationships. A logical consequence doesn’t necessarily occur naturally due to a person’s behavior like getting burned when touching a hot stove, rather it’s imposed by someone else, but it should be logically related to the behavior. For example, let’s say a family has a rule, the dirty clothes have to be put in the laundry hamper in order to be washed, but an elderly family member leaves his dirty clothes on the floor, then a logical consequence would be to leave them there and not wash them. Chances are the next time that person needs to clean shirt, he or she will realize that dirty clothes have to be put in the appropriate place. 

00:29:45
CHARLES FAWCETT So having no clean shirts will offer a valuable learning experience. 

00:29:45
Three R’s of Logical Consequences: Related Reasonable Respectful 

00:29:50
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes it will. Logical consequences can be amazingly effective if they are based on the three horse(ph) and that is if they are related to the behavior, reasonable and respectful to elaborate. The logical consequences should be related to the actual problematic behavior in a direct and obvious way as in the previous example. The logical consequence should be reasonable and not out of proportion to the behavior. For example, it would be obviously inappropriate to refuse to ever wash the family member shirts again. Finally, the logical consequence should be respectful. And by that, I mean it shouldn’t be administered with (inaudible ) or be designed to humiliate the person. For example, it wouldn’t be respectful to tell the family member, your shirts didn’t get washed because you left them on the floor, you felt be pig. 

00:30:45
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes that wouldn’t likely add insult to injury. 

00:30:45
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, it would. If the logical consequences conform to the three R’s and are related and reasonable and respectful, they should promote cooperation and not seem like punishment. Here’s an example of another logical consequence. A daughter found that whenever she took her elderly father places such as doctors appointments or family gatherings, he always cause them to be late. For example, if they were supposed to be somewhere at 9 o’clock that was at 30-minute drive away, he would suggest that they leave at 8:30. However, when the daughter arrive, the father would always need to go to the bathroom, look for his sunglasses or something else. So, they always arrive to their destination at least 15 minutes late, often even later. This caused her to feel embarrassed and stressed. Therefore, the daughter told her father that because it always took him at least 15 minutes to actually get out of his house. She would need to pick him up 15 minutes earlier than usual. So, if the appointment was at 9, she would be at his house at 8:15. Because he didn’t like to get up any earlier than necessary, this solve the problem and he became much better at leaving properly at the time they agreed upon. 

00:32:00
CHARLES FAWCETT Radha, you said that was such familiarity. Is that someone you know? 

00:32:05
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, it is. 

00:32:05
CHARLES FAWCETT (inaudible ) I thought. The logical consequence sure worked well and it conformed to the three R’s. So, let’s move on to the next technique now. 

00:32:15
Use a family council to addres issues. 

00:32:15
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Okay. To address the inevitable problems that arise in families such as the one we just mentioned. suggested holding regular family council sessions. The family council should meet at regular intervals, perhaps every week or twice a month depending on how often the caregiver is with the elderly person. And when any family member has a concern, he or she would put the issue on the agenda for the next family council. At that time, the issue would be discussed among all involved family members, and a solution would be a agreed upon. The proposed solution would then be tried for next week or until the next family council, and then evaluated to see how it was working. It help that by doing this everyone’s needs would be met at least to some degree. 

00:33:05
CHARLES FAWCETT Well so, who should attend a family council meeting? 

00:33:05
RADHA HORTON-PARKER That’s a good question Charlie. Often, extended family members are involved in caring for elderly persons, but they may not live with them. And for that reason, I would suggest any family members who are regularly involved in the life of the elderly person should be included in the family council. For example, let’s say the elderly father lives alone, but his daughter and her husband help out with yard work and other task. Lately, however, the choice has been piling up and the adult caregivers have been too busy with their jobs to get to them. The fathers feelings frustrated about the condition of the yard, the son-in-laws feeling over burdened and the daughter is feeling overwhelmed and guilty. Therefore, the daughter puts the issue on the agenda for the next family council meeting. At that time, the three of them prioritize the task and who might do them consider the possibility of hiring outside help, discuss who should pay for it and plan a schedule for getting everything done. The family council end with them having a plan, so that every ones needs might be addressed. 

00:34:20
CHARLES FAWCETT Well that’s a great example of how effective a family council meeting can be for everyone. 

00:34:25
RADHA HORTON-PARKER That’s right Charlie. And it’s also a good safe way into our next strategy, which involves careful listening. 

00:34:30
Listen. 

00:34:30
CHARLES FAWCETT Spending time simply listening to our parents without judgment, correction or a barrage of questions, maybe one of the most important things we can do for them. Everyone needs to be heard and as their aging parents social circle and other supports decrease, they need… they have very few people who they can listen and… and talk with. Whether the older person lives alone or an assisted care or nursing facility; there maybe a very few people with whom she or he can regular communicate. Therefore, you should schedule sufficient time in your routine just to have ah… talk time before you go (inaudible ), talking in the car and stores nice, but it’s not focused communication. Sit down with the older person in the kitchen or in a sitting area, face to face with him or her, speak slowly and audibly and give your undivided attention. Realize this maybe more important to your parent and grocer shopping or other tasks. Remember the chores that he or she ask or often just excuse to spend time with you. So don’t underestimate the importance of just taking time to listen to them each week. 

00:35:35
Have fun and share quality time together. 

00:35:35
RADHA HORTON-PARKER And it’s also important to adjust our pace to that of the older person. Because their internal rhythms and mental processes move more than slowly than ours. We need to give them plenty of time to express their thoughts. Even though, it may be tempting to finish their sentences for them or hurry them along, we need to resist their urge to rush them. Instead, we should slow ourselves down and go with their speed. Sometimes, this involves hearing many irrelevant details before older persons get to the real point, but to not listen to the whole story is to imply disrespect for their concerns, and that can be discouraging to them. Listening and spending quality time are both essential. As we’ve said, one of the greatest unmet needs of older persons is to receive attention. They simply want to belong and to feel value. It’s also important for adult children to schedule quality time to just have fun with their aging parents. If you can create or find activities that are pleasurable for both of you, every ones needs can be met. Simply taking care of chores leaves most of the joy out of the relationship. That’s why it’s better to take some opportunities to just be together and enjoy each others company. For example, having a meal together participating in a religious observance or just playing a game of cards on a Saturday evening can offer wonderful opportunities for bonding and strengthening the relationship. Also, life review or reminiscence can help older adults achieve a greater sense of integrity and wellbeing. So, encouraging them to recount the stories of their youth can be time spent. Many wonderful memories can be shared while looking at family photographs, watching old home movies, listening to favorite music from the past, or reading old letters together. Now, let’s go back to Darla and see how her mother might have reacted, if she tried some of these alternative responses to Anne’s attention seeking behavior. 

00:37:55
Attention Example 2 

00:38:00
DARLA Ah… Okay, Mom. I think I got it all done. 

00:38:05
ANNE Hmm… 

00:38:05
DARLA Can you believe that I’ve been here almost five hours. But I really do think I got everything done for you today. 

00:38:10
ANNE Yeah. 

00:38:10
DARLA Let’s say, I went to the store and I got your hedge trimmers and I trim the hedge for you. 

00:38:15
ANNE Yeah. Hmm…Hmm… 

00:38:15
DARLA And I’ve got the winter treatment and I hung that, and I think that works very nice. 

00:38:20
ANNE Yeah, yeah. 

00:38:20
DARLA Okay. And I got the flag pole bracket and I’ll fix that and so, now you can fly your flag. Okay, and I’m all done with your list. 

00:38:30
ANNE Well, I’m really appreciated honey. 

00:38:30
DARLA And Mom, I really appreciate your making the list so that I could get everything done at one time. 

00:38:35
ANNE Well, you know Darla, well this wasn’t so hard making that list… 

00:38:40
DARLA No. 

00:38:40
ANNE But there is one more thing. I wonder if you would mind taking a look at the toaster, it isn’t working right. 

00:38:50
DARLA Well, you know Mom? I only have about a half an hour left. So, why don’t we look at your scrap book. 

00:38:55
ANNE Well, can you look at the toaster too? 

00:38:55
DARLA No, Mom. You remember that we had agreed at our last family council meeting, that I would only do the things that were on the list and if you’ve forget something, then we would put it on a list for next week and do it then. 

00:39:10
ANNE Well, I remember the agreement, but what if you forgot to put something on the list, like my toaster? 

00:39:20
DARLA Well, I really understand you’re frustrated about the toaster, but you know, is it emergency to have the toaster? 

00:39:25
ANNE Well, I’m… I’m used to it. And… and I just don’t know what I’ll do without that. 

00:39:30
DARLA Well, I understand that, but what could you do without the toaster for a week? 

00:39:35
ANNE Well, do you mean the microwave? 

00:39:40
DARLA Yeah that’s a great option. That would work. 

00:39:45
ANNE Well, yes. I guess so. 

00:39:45
DARLA Good. Okay. Now, how about we get back to the scrap book? 

00:39:50
ANNE Alright. And listen, I want to show you this picture. I just put this one in here, a view with your big yellow daffy duck, right? I was right? 

00:40:00
DARLA (inaudible ) looked like I’m terrified. 

00:40:05
ANNE Well, you got over that after a while. 

00:40:10
DARLA I guess so. 

00:40:10
ANNE And didn’t we have such phone at the beach. 

00:40:10
DARLA Oh, we do. We made a lot of great memories down the (crosstalk). And you know what Mom? The nicest memory was that you were so happy there. 

00:40:20
ANNE Well, yes I was. 

00:40:20
CHARLES FAWCETT Well that certainly had a much better outcome in the first (inaudible ). 

00:40:26
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, it did. Darla, you can see how Darla managed to meet her Mom’s need for attention in a way that strengthen their relationship rather than diminishing it. 

00:40:35
CHARLES FAWCETT Exactly. It really help her create a sense of a belonging or connectedness with her. 

00:40:40
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes. And by relating to her… her Mom as a person there was much less emphasis on just doing task and much more on the… just appreciating their relationship. 

00:40:55
CHARLES FAWCETT Exactly. That’s really the relationship that matters. So let’s move on now to the second mistaken goal. Radha, why don’t you discuss that one? 

00:41:00
The Four Mistaken Goals of Behavior: 1. Attention 2. Power 3. Revenge 4. Assumed Inadequacy 

00:41:00
RADHA HORTON-PARKER I’d be glad to. If an older adult is unable to get the attention that he or she needs, that person may resort to the next mistaken goal, that power. Due to frustration from her perceived lack of attention, the elderly person may feel threatened that his or her needs will not be met. And so, he or she may, they’re by just refused to comply with request from a child or a care taker. This refusal is a demonstration of the elderly person sense a personal power. It’s also in means of getting the caregivers attention, I’ll be at a negative one. So, if we find ourselves getting into a power struggle with an older adult, it could be a sign that he or she is feeling frustrated with the lack of attention he or she is receiving. In the following video, we’ll look at a situation in which must pick up her spouse at the airport during her Mom’s previously scheduled hair appointment. This results in a power struggle between Darla and her Mom. 

00:42:10
Power Example 1 

00:42:15
DARLA Hi, Mom. 

00:42:15
ANNE Hello. Hi, Darla. 

00:42:15
DARLA How you doing? 

00:42:20
ANNE I’m good baby. 

00:42:20
DARLA Good, good to see you. 

00:42:20
ANNE Thank you. 

00:42:20
DARLA Mom, I have to tell you umm… I’m not gonna be able to take you to your hair appointment on Wednesday like you normally do with Shirley. 

00:42:30
ANNE Ah… 

00:42:30
DARLA You know Rex been out of town and he is flying then on Wednesday and I have to pick him up at the airport. But let’s see uh… I think I can take you Thursday afternoon, could you change your appointment until then? 

00:42:45
ANNE No. Shirley doesn’t work on Thursdays. 

00:42:45
DARLA Well, I understand that, but you know there are other people at the saloon, couldn’t someone else do your hair? 

00:42:50
ANNE No. I need a hair cut, and only Shirley can cut my hair. 

00:43:00
DARLA Well, Mom I’m sorry, I just don’t see what the big problem is. There are other people there that can cut your hair, maybe even better than Shirley. 

00:43:05
ANNE No. No one is as good as Shirley. 

00:43:10
DARLA Mom, you’ve got to be kidding. The last time she cut your hair look like rap that you didn’t want it. I’m sorry, I think she has a problem. Maybe even a drinking problem. 

00:43:20
ANNE I wish you wouldn’t talk like that about Shirley. That’s just not right. It’s disrespectful. And how do you know about everything going on anyway? You don’t even know this when I have her haircut or not? 

00:43:35
DARLA Mom, I do too. I don’t know how you can say that. I’m over here all the time week after week. 

00:43:40
ANNE Well, you know what? You only think about yourself. You do not think about me. 

00:43:45
DARLA Mom, I do not, you know Thursday is it, it’s the only time I can do it. 

00:43:50
ANNE If you love me Darla, you would take me on Wednesday. 

00:44:00
CHARLES FAWCETT Wow, they were certainly engaging a power struggle. 

00:44:00
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, they were. And as you can see, Darla’s mother was trying to win to prove that she was still powerful by engaging her daughter in a power struggle, she was attempting to keep her involved. The message this behavior conveys is that Anne thinks, I only count when I’m winning, if when I get my own way. 

00:44:25
CHARLES FAWCETT So how cunning can we tell when a power struggles are beginning to occur? 

00:44:25
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Well, usually it’s pretty obvious as it was in the video that we just saw. But we can always identify that mistake involved by the feelings of frustration and anger that are engendered in us. And the urge that we ourselves have to win the dispute. As you just saw, Darla wanted to win, but arguing with her Mom accomplish nothing. It only intensify the struggle for power and ended up making both of them feel worse. Attempts to dominate or cohorts and aging loved one will probably only end with a battle and resentment. If you’re trying to influence with the elderly person, the only finding resistance, it means your approach is not working. Try a new angle. We must remember that, although we maybe caring for them, our parents are still our parents, and they don’t wish to be controlled by us. We probably didn’t like to be bossed around by them when we were children, I know I didn’t. And they don’t appreciate being treated that way by us. Therefore, it’s not productive to… to demand that they do things our way or to try to force them to cooperate. We can only be firm about what we’re willing to do, not about what we think our parents must do. 

00:45:55
CHARLES FAWCETT And so, what can be done, if a power struggle begins? 

00:45:55
Withdraw from the power struggle 

00:45:55
RADHA HORTON-PARKER That’s an excellent question, Charlie and it’s tempting to want to continue to argue. But in power struggles, a far better strategy is withdrawal. Withdrawal is an effective intervention that consist of extricating ourselves from conflict while showing respect for the relationships. For example, if a power struggle is ensuing, you might just say, I love you Mom, but I’ve got to go now. I’ll see you on Tuesday at the normal time. It’s important, however that we don’t do this to manipulate or punish or hurt the elder person. If you need to withdraw from the situation, but want to avoid cutting your time short with your parent, you might just leave the room for a few minutes, or try simply changing the subject, sometimes that will work. Remember though that engaging in lengthy arguments or attempting to rationally win an argument is not productive. By continuing to argue with her Mom, Darla was meeting her Mom’s unhealthy need for power by staying engaged. In other words, her Mom had already won by keeping her daughter involved in the argument. As just stated, withdrawal might involve Darla literally removing herself from the debate. 

00:47:15
Use action, not words. 

00:47:15
RADHA HORTON-PARKER This would be one way using action rather than words. In power struggles, the older person expects you to continue to argue, which usually results in everyone feeling worse. So, it’s far better to take action. One way to do this is to take the elderly person by the hand and leave him or her to a different location or maybe distract him or her with a new activity or idea. For example, if your elderly mother is starting to argue with you about the way you’re preparing a meal, rather than engaging in the power struggle, just put your arm around her assure her into the living room, and ask her to assist you with another task such as Mom, while I’m making dinner, why don’t you look through these fabrics watches I picked up at the fabric store and see if you can help me pick out some for a new currents, maybe you could help me decide on a color. Another technique for dealing with the power struggle is to admit defeat. 

00:48:20
Admit defeat. Win co-operation. 

00:48:20
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Tell the older adult that you realize you can make him or her do anything and that the decision is ultimately his or hers. It can also be helpful to try to win the older adults cooperation rather than simply demanding it. 

00:48:40
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, no one enjoys feeling pressured, impose upon or bullied. We cannot and should not attempt to force older adults and to going along with their wishes. We need to win their cooperation by being polite and respectful. Listening to them and attempting to address their concerns. Sometimes, it can work well just to ask their input regarding the issue and say something like, well we’ve got a real problem here. What do you suggest we do? 

00:49:05
offer limited choices. 

00:49:05
RADHA HORTON-PARKER It’s also very helpful to offer them limited choices. And by that, I mean options it would hopefully be acceptable to both of you. For example, in cases of power struggles, rather than asking would you like to go to the store with me, which will often get a known response, it might be better to ask, would you rather go to the store with me now or in a half hour? By giving the older person a choice, you allow him or her to feel empowered. Another useful strategy is to refrain from overprotection. 

00:49:45
Refrain from overprotection. 

00:49:45
RADHA HORTON-PARKER We love our parents, and of course, we don’t wanna see them hurt. However, we must remember to let them live their own lives and make their own decisions, assuming their mentally competent. We shouldn’t try to make them do things our way or discourage them from doing things for themselves. If we continually try to protect them or make decisions for them or perform tasks, they could safely accomplish on their own. We deny them the opportunity to live life on their own terms. We also run the risk of harming our relationship with them. Therefore, unless there’s extreme risk of older person’s injuring themselves or others, for example driving legally blind, we need to refrain from overprotecting them. Attempting to take control from elderly may lead to them demanding more of our attention or engaging in an increased power struggles with us. Of course, that doesn’t mean that we should neglect them, but rather than we should try to avoid creating dependency. 

00:50:50
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, it’s always a good idea to access whether they’re capable performing a task or making the decision. If they aren’t, we should definitely offer assistance. If they are capable, however sometimes, a little (inaudible ) and go a long way. Now, let’s see how Darla might have used these strategies with her mother when they have their power struggle. 

00:51:15
Power Example 2 

00:51:15
DARLA Hi, Mom. How are you doing? 

00:51:20
ANNE Hi! 

00:51:20
DARLA It’s good to see you. 

00:51:20
ANNE Hi, Darla. Good to see you. 

00:51:20
DARLA Listen, I… I kinda hate to tell you this, but next Wednesday I’m not gonna be able to take for your normal hair appointment with Shirley. You know Rick have been out of town and he’s gonna be flying back in then and I need to go to the airport and pick him up. But I will have some time on Thursday, do you suppose you could change you appointment until then? 

00:51:45
ANNE No. Shirley doesn’t work on Thursdays. 

00:51:50
DARLA Well, I understand that, but you know there are other people like this salon, couldn’t somebody else do your hair? 

00:51:55
ANNE No. No one is as good as Shirley. 

00:52:00
DARLA Okay, Mom. I need to use the bathroom just a minute. I’ll be right back. 

00:52:05
[sil.] 

00:52:15
DARLA Listen, Mom. I know you’re disappointed that I can’t take you on Wednesday like I normally do. But you know, I’m sorry. Rick is coming in from other town and I have to pick him up and I don’t seem to be able to talk you until the other options about this. So, how about… let’s think what we do have and trying to make a solution here. I can either take you next Wednesday like I normally do or you can go on Thursday and let someone different do your hair? The choice is yours. What’s your decision? 

00:52:50
ANNE Well, I guess I can go next Wednesday. 

00:52:50
DARLA Oh, thanks so much Mom. 

00:52:55
ANNE Hmm…Hmm… 

00:52:55
DARLA Hmm… I really appreciate you’re being flexible for me. 

00:53:00
ANNE Yeah. 

00:53:00
CHARLES FAWCETT Well that certainly had a much happier ending. 

00:53:05
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, it did. Darla managed to withdraw herself literally from the power struggle, and then manage to win Anne’s cooperation. By giving Anne a choice, Darla empowered her Mom and thus diffused her Mom’s need to win the power struggle. Now, Anne may not have been delighted, but at least the power struggle ended. As in the side, it may seem odd that Anne was so insistent on having surely do her hair. Especially, considering that almost no one sees her during the week. As we mentioned however, belongingness is important at every age, but perhaps, a specially critical and challenging in later adulthood. In fact, as their own autonomy decreases, older persons have an increased need to merge with their caregivers and form exceptionally close connections. In this case, Anne and Shirley had established a very close relationship. Anne didn’t care so much about the hair styling. She treasured the time that she spent together every week. And because she look forward to her time with Shirley, was only natural for Anne to be upset about having to miss the appointment. Now let’s move on to the third mistaken goal. 

00:54:25
The Four Mistaken Goals of Behavior: 1. Attention 2. Power 3. Revenge 4. Assumed Inadequacy 

00:54:30
CHARLES FAWCETT The third mistaken goal Revenge is the outcome of the continued downward spiral of the previous power struggle. If an older person has become discouraged, but what he or she perceives as a lack of attention and then becomes frustrated by losing a power struggle he or she may feel the only option is left is to retaliate and hurt the person that is keeping him or her from achieving a sense of belongingness. In the next (inaudible ), you’ll see an example of this mistaken goal. 

00:55:00

00:55:20
ANNE Darla, it was little chilly in here, isn’t it? 

00:55:25
DARLA You do look a little cold, Mom. Where is that new sweater that I bought you for your birthday? And you tell me where it is, I’ll be happy to go and get it for you. 

00:55:30
ANNE It’s not here. 

00:55:35
DARLA Oh, what do you mean its not here? 

00:55:35
ANNE It’s gone. 

00:55:35
DARLA Well, where did it go Mom? The sweaters just don’t get up and walk away. 

00:55:40
ANNE I gave it away. 

00:55:45
DARLA To whom? 

00:55:45
ANNE To salvation army. 

00:55:50
DARLA What? You gave away that ridiculous expensive sweater that I got you for your birthday to the salvation army. 

00:56:00
ANNE Yes, I did. I didn’t know when you would ever going to take me anywhere special. So, I decided to give it to the salvation army. 

00:56:10
DARLA Mom, do you know how much time and energy and money I spent on getting that special gift for you? I just can’t believe you did that. I give up, Mom that really takes the cake. See if I ever get anything special for you again. 

00:56:35
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Oouch! Darla’s feelings must have really been hurt. 

00:56:40
CHARLES FAWCETT Oh, yes. If Revenge is the elderly persons mistaken goal, the message that behavior sends is you’ve hurt me so I’m gonna hurt you. The caregiver may feel hurt or betrayed and wonder how could this person do such a thing to me? 

00:56:55
RADHA HORTON-PARKER It must be really difficult to refrain from doing or saying something hurtful and return. 

00:57:00
CHARLES FAWCETT Oh, exactly. It takes a lot of self control, but of course, doing something hurtful would only aggravate the situation, and then everyone would feel even worse. If the elderly person become spiteful and engages in hurtful behavior, it is often because he or she is feeling discourage. When this happens, it’s important for the caregiver not to take it personally. Instead, he or she should realize that the behavior is an attempt to relive the hurt the older person is experiencing. 

00:57:30
RADHA HORTON-PARKER So what can be done instead? 

00:57:30
Show empathy, build trust and restore the relationship 

00:57:30
CHARLES FAWCETT Well, it’s the older person’s pain that is the source of his or her desire for revenge. So it’s helpful to show empathy, build trust and try to restore the relationship. 

00:57:45
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Charlie, maybe you could say a few words about how to express sympathy? 

00:57:45
CHARLES FAWCETT That’s a good idea. An easy way to express empathy is to use the following formula. You feel blank because blank. The first blank would be filled in with a feeling word such as sad, disappointed or angry. The second blank would be filled in with a statement regarding the reason such as because you don’t think I spend enough quality time with you. So, you might say, you feel disappointed because you don’t think I spend enough quality time with you. 

00:58:15
RADHA HORTON-PARKER That’s a simple, but effective method of making an empathic statement. That will certainly help to show your understanding of the other person’s concerns. 

00:58:25
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, and I messages can be useful too. Why don’t you discuss those, Radha? 

00:58:30
Use “I-messages”, rather than “You-messages”. 

00:58:30
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Sure. I’d be glad to. In conflicts, I messages are much better than You messages because they’re less accusatory. You messages tend to make the other person defensive while I messages are more likely to promote cooperation. For example, let’s your elderly mother has made the decision without consulting you to go visit an old friend for the holidays, rather than coming to your home as you had expected. You might be tempted to give your mother a You message and say something like, you only think about yourself and you don’t consider me at all. Of course that’s likely to get a negative response. So, a more helpful strategy might be to use an I message. The formula for an I message is I feel blank because blank. In this case, the first blank would be filled in with how you feel and the second blank would be filled in with why you have those feelings. For example, a good I message in this case might be I feel hurt because you made your plans without consulting me. 

00:59:40
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, showing empathy and giving I messages can be amazingly affective when dealing with almost any relationship issue. Now, let’s see what might happen if Darla had used some of these strategies with her mother.

01:00:30
ANNE It’s not here. 

01:00:30
DARLA What do you mean its not here? 

01:00:35
ANNE It’s gone. 

01:00:35
DARLA Where did it go mom? Sweaters just don’t get up and walk away. 

01:00:40
ANNE I gave it away. 

01:00:45
DARLA To whom? 

01:00:45
ANNE The Salvation Army. 

01:00:50
DARLA What? You gave away that ridiculously expensive sweater that I got you for your birthday to The Salvation Army. 

01:01:00
ANNE Yes, I did. I didn’t know when you were ever going to take me anywhere special, so I decided to give it to The Salvation Army. 

01:01:10
DARLA Oh, mom that really hurts my feelings. Do you have any idea how much time I took to look for something especially right for you. I put a lot of thought and love into that getting that you that sweater. You know I just don’t understand. 

01:01:30
ANNE Well, Darla, I know that you’ve come over here and you do a lot of jobs for me and I appreciate it, but you’re always rushing and hurrying about so that you can leave. 

01:01:45
DARLA Well, you know, I understand what you are saying. I guess you’re feeling a little bit abandoned that I am not with you as much as I used to be. I… I know I stay really busy but you know I'm doing choice for you and all. 

01:01:55
ANNE Well, you know we don’t ever go out to tea or anything like that. I used to go with your aunt Agnes before she died and since then I haven’t had anybody to do that with and you know it was kind of start of a little girl thing. 

01:02:15
DARLA Oh, mom, I am sorry, I didn’t know tea was that important to you. How is this? How about next week when I come over to do the chores we go out and have a little girl time before I do them. Would that work? 

01:02:30
ANNE Oh, Darla, that would be wonderful and that’s something I am going to look forward to. 

01:02:35
DARLA Okay. 

01:02:35
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Oh, that worked much better. I am impressed that Darla was able to avoid losing her temper with her mom and instead make their relationship a higher priority than her own heart feelings. 

01:02:50
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, that must have taken tremendous amount of self-control. (inaudible ) before responding can definitely help. And then it brings us to the last mistaken goal, assumed inadequacy. 

01:03:00
RADHA HORTON-PARKER If an older adult becomes completely discouraged, he or she may pursue the last mistaken goal that of assumed inadequacy. At this point, the elderly person feels so helpless and depressed that he or she may exaggerate personal deficiencies. For example, if I can’t drive anymore, then I can’t cook or clean either. It’s a stance of I give up. This is the most severe form of discouragement resulting from a lack of belonging. In the following vineyard(ph) you will see how Darla’s mom assumed a stance of inadequacy. 

01:03:45
Assumed Inadequacy Example 1 

01:03:50
DARLA By the way mom, did I tell you that we are damn sure the beach is coming up soon. We would really love for you to come with us. Would you like to come? 

01:04:05
ANNE No. I don’t go out on the beach anymore on the sand, it’s just too hot. 

01:04:10
DARLA Well, you know you don’t have to go out on the beach with us. We can visit in the afternoon when we come in off the beach and... and by the way I can take you to some of those shops that you enjoy to visit. 

01:04:20
ANNE No, I can’t do that. My knee is hurting so bad that I can’t stand on it long enough to go shopping. 

01:04:30
DARLA Oh, mom, I'm sorry. That knee does look like it’s bothering you, must be horrible to have to hobble around like that, but okay, we don’t have to go shopping, we can go to some nice restaurants in the evening, I know you love the sea food. 

01:04:45
ANNE No, the prices are just too high and it’s just the waste of good money and but that you know I'm not supposed to have food with a lot of salt in it. 

01:04:55
DARLA Oh, mom, come on. It’s… it’s getting everyone together. Don’t you like to have the family together? 

01:05:05
ANNE No, I’d just be a burden. You all just go on and have a good time. 

01:05:10
DARLA Oh, mom. Alright. I give up I just don’t know what else to do with you. I guess we’ll just have to go to the beach without you. 

01:05:25
CHARLES FAWCETT Darla’s mom certainly had a lot of excuses. 

01:05:25
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, she did. And you can see how everyone of them conveyed the message that she was feeling defeated. It’s as though she was saying I am completely powerless, I no longer matter to anyone and so I’ll just give up. 

01:05:45
CHARLES FAWCETT But she really wasn’t powerless. Why she? 

01:05:45
RADHA HORTON-PARKER No, she wasn’t, but she felt that she was. And as Adler emphasized it’s our perceptions that motivate our behavior, not actual reality. Darla’s mother no longer felt that she had the same degree of power over her daughter or over her own world that she once had. So she assumed a position of inadequacy. 

01:06:15
CHARLES FAWCETT That ends up being hard on Darla. 

01:06:15
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, it does. When a parent assumes a posture of inadequacy, it’s tempting for the adult child to simply give up to. After all it can seem hopeless to keep trying when the older person seems so unwilling to put forth any effort at all. Of course that would only leave to the older person doing even less and giving up even more. Charlie, why don’t you talk about what can be done when that happens? 

01:06:45
Provide encouragement 

01:06:45
CHARLES FAWCETT Certainly. One of the Adler’s most important concepts was that of encouragement. In fact, he assumed that most problematic behaviors occur because individuals are discouraged and obvious antidote to discouragement is encouragement. Adler pointed out that children can easily become discouraged as they attempt to acquire new skills such as learning to walk, to do school work, ride a bike, so they need frequent encouragement. Well similarly older adults need encouragement and support too. Much human satisfaction is derived from completing a job and being controller of our lives. Yet as adults age, completing task can become more challenging (inaudible ) some of the basic sense of self-efficacy they once enjoyed. As a result, they may become discouraged and feel worthless or unwanted. 

01:07:35
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, that’s so true. Dreikrus once said that an irresponsible child is a demanding child and that children should therefore be encouraged to do things for themselves to the best of their abilities. We believe that the same rule can be applied to older adults. We should not take responsibilities from older adults if they are still capable of doing because doing so only tends to discourage them. Instead, we need to provide copious encouragement and assist them if they need it as they do the tasks for themselves. We also need to reassure them that they’re wanted and valued even if they aren’t able to do all the things they once did. 

01:08:20
CHARLES FAWCETT Granted, (inaudible ) again sometimes it’s be difficult to determine if elderly persons can still perform certain tasks, but we have no right to deprive them the joy of living and accomplishing the task that they can complete. We also want to avoid the undue burden of carrying for them when it’s not required. Doing so is not only exhausting for us but also disrespectful to them. 

01:08:40
Keep trying 

01:08:40
RADHA HORTON-PARKER We also have to keep trying. It’s essential for the caregiver to not give up in attempting to reach out to the older person, even though he or she may fear that it’s a loss caused. We must remind ourselves that to give up trying will only reinforce the sense of inadequacy that the older person already has. 

01:09:00
Continue to listen. 

01:09:00
CHARLES FAWCETT And listening to the older person can also be a wonderful way to form a connection even if what you are hearing this mostly a reiteration of how he or she can do anything anymore. 

01:09:10
Show empathy rather than sympathy 

01:09:10
RADHA HORTON-PARKER And as we listen, showing empathy lets the parent know that we care. In cases of assumed inadequacy, it’s important to avoid conveying sympathy or pity. However, because doing that only reinforces the older person’s feelings of deficiency. Just as it’s damaging to pity our own children, it’s also harmful to do so with our aging parents. 

01:09:35
CHARLES FAWCETT In this case, empathy is much better than sympathy. 

01:09:40
RADHA HORTON-PARKER That’s right. Pity serves only one purpose. It encourages us to feel sorry for ourselves. Consequently, if we verbally or nonverbally communicate pity for our aging loved one, it will only foster self-commiseration and possible depression. 

01:10:00
CHARLES FAWCETT That’s why it’s more helpful to communicate empathy, which is kind and compassionate rather than conveying pity. Empathic responses show that we understand the other person’s problems and cares. However, feeling started for the older persons doesn’t do anyone good. For example, if any unfortunate event one of our parents lost (inaudible ) do that complications with diabetes, we would need to communicate understanding warmth and encouragement. But if we were to pity him or her, this would only create discouragement harm his or herself concept and retard healing and adjustment. Let’s see how Darla might have used these strategies with her mother. 

01:10:40
Complete Inadequacy Example 2 

01:10:50
DARLA Mom, did I remember to tell you that our beach time share is coming up soon and we would really love for you to come with us? Would you like to do that? 

01:11:00
ANNE No, I don’t go on to beach anymore. 

01:11:00
DARLA Well, I know. You don’t have to go out on the beach, we can visit in the afternoon when we come up from the beach. And… and I could take you to some cute shops that you like to go to. 

01:11:10
ANNE No. Ah… My knee hurts I… I can’t stand up long enough to go shopping. 

01:11:15
DARLA Oh, gosh mom, that knee looks like it really has been bothering you. You’ve been rubbing that a lot more likely? 

01:11:25
ANNE Well, yes. (inaudible ) with all the (inaudible ) that we’ve had, it’s really been acting up. 

01:11:30
DARLA Oh, so the damp weather really causes that arthritis to act up in… in your leg hurts more. Huh? 

01:11:35
ANNE The arthritis, it’s crusading. 

01:11:40
DARLA Oh, that must be terrible mom. I’m so sorry. Umm… No wonder you’re kind of torn between wanting to go to the beach with us and… and… and your leg, that, that’s a horrible position to be on. But you know, but we could workout a solution to that? 

01:12:00
ANNE Well, if I… if I keep my foot up like that and umm… I keep the heat on it, it… it’s really not that bad. 

01:12:10
DARLA Well, I’ll tell what. Why you don’t want to come to the beach and, and we can let you rest and put your foot up and, and the family would be all together and, and that’s really what’s most important, isn’t it? We’ll make a lot of happy memories? 

01:12:25
ANNE Well, I guess, I could use a few more pictures for my scrapbook. 

01:12:30
DARLA There you go. That’s the attitude mom. 

01:12:35
RADHA HORTON-PARKER And so, through Darla’s listening and showing empathy and encouragement and finally, agreed to go on the family get together. 

01:12:45
CHARLES FAWCETT But, what if Anne had thought about it and changed her mind, decided not to go? 

01:12:50
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Oh, that’s very likely to happen. When someone is discouraged and displaying complete inadequacy, it’s highly probable that this won’t easily change. That’s why it’s so important for the adult child to continue to encourage the aging parent. Promote his or her self reliance and not give up. That’s so important. Just remember, don’t give up. In the next (inaudible ), you’ll see how Darla initially fell into the unfortunate pattern of doing a test for her mother that Anne could have done for herself. That’s contributing to her sense of inadequacy. 

01:13:30
Need for Encouragement Example 1 

01:13:35
ANNE You know Darla I want to go to church this Sunday… 

01:13:40
DARLA Hmm… 

01:13:40
DARLA But they haven’t do schedule now, and I don’t know what time the services going to start? Ah… Well, I guess I could stay home. 

01:13:50
DARLA Well, why don’t you just try to find out the time? 

01:13:55
ANNE Well, that’s a good idea honey, but you know would you make that call for me? 

01:14:00
DARLA Okay, mom. I’ll go, look at the number in the phonebook and make the call for you and find out what time church starts. 

01:14:10
CHARLES FAWCETT So, Darla annoyingly contributed to her mother’s sense of inadequacy? 

01:14:15
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes, she just reinforced her mother’s sense of helplessness. Let’s see how it might have gone differently if Darla had used encouragement instead. 

01:14:30
Need for Encouragement Example 2 

01:14:35
ANNE You know, Darla I want to go to church this Sunday… 

01:14:35
DARLA Umm…Hmm… 

01:14:40
ANNE But they have a schedule for the service and I don’t know what time it is. Well, I guess, I could stay home. 

01:14:50
DARLA Well, no. Why don’t you try to find out the time? 

01:14:50
ANNE But, I don’t know the number. You know they have that thing that you have press one for something and two for something and none have shown how do deal with that. 

01:15:05
DARLA Mom, I’ve called to church before and there is no automated menu. It’s just the church secretary and she is very nice and I know she’d be happy to answer any of your questions. 

01:15:15
ANNE Well, I don’t know the number, Darla. 

01:15:20
DARLA Oh, isn’t that your old church bulletin over there about the number in there. 

01:15:30
ANNE Oh! Yes, here it is. 

01:15:35
DARLA See, and you did that a lot faster than I could have if, if I had looked it up for you. You know, I know you can do this mom. Why don’t you make the phone call now and I’m here in case anything goes wrong, I’ll be happy to help. 

01:15:50
ANNE Well, okay. 

01:15:55
[sil.] 

01:16:00
ANNE Hi, is this Rose? Rose, would you please tell me what time the services going to begin on Sunday? Oh, 10 O’clock. Ah… okay. That’s good. I’ll be there. Thanks so much, Rose. That was Rose. 

01:16:20
DARLA Uh…Huh… 

01:16:25
ANNE And she is so nice. 

01:16:25
DARLA I told you. 

01:16:25
ANNE And you know what, Darla? They are going to have muffins and coffee after the service and she wanted me to come. 

01:16:30
DARLA Yes. See, I’m so proud of you mom, I know you could do at all along. 

01:16:40
CHARLES FAWCETT So, when dealing with a parent who is displaying inadequacy, we should take every opportunity to encourage them. 

01:16:45
RADHA HORTON-PARKER That’s absolutely right. As you’ve seen throughout this video, the bottom line is to keep trying and not to come to discouragement ourselves. Of course, that takes a lot of patience and inner strength, which we can only have if we find ways to renew a nurture ourselves. 

01:17:05
Make self-care a priority too. 

01:17:05
RADHA HORTON-PARKER So, I strongly recommend that every caregiver look for a ways to take care of himself or herself as well his or her loved one. It’s critically important to make self-care, a priority too. And now, we are almost out of time, but we have a few closing thoughts. Throughout this video, you’ve observed how Darla worked hard to overcome her mother’s mistake and goals, so that the two of them could have a more satisfying relationship. 

01:17:40
CHARLES FAWCETT Yes, she has certainly worked hard at it, but at the end result was worth it. As you’ve seen the four mistaken goals, which may manifest and bother some in this concerting behaviors are simply the older person’s attempts at achieving a sense of belongingness or being needed. The elderly adult is just trying to feel that he or she is still counts and still matters. 

01:18:00
RADHA HORTON-PARKER Yes. And although, the behaviors can end deep be perplexing. When we understand the needs behind the behaviors, we can have much more compassion. Older person simply want to feel that they’re still respected, needed, and a part of the larger social fabric, regardless of age, we are all part of that (inaudible ) history of life. And its caregiving adults, we have an opportunity to honor and respect those who came before us. 

01:18:35
CHARLES FAWCETT After all, for it had not been for the older generation, we won’t be here to day. 

01:18:40
RADHA HORTON-PARKER They paved the way for us and the way we treat them, may well be the model for how we’ll be treated when we reach our golden years. May at be with dignity, love and respect. I’d like to end with the poem I wrote about my own dad, Here it is. “Today, I hold my father’s hand in mine to help him upstairs that he must climb. A rose have changed in such short time, but our hearts and souls are still in (inaudible ) and with every step I take great pride as he wants did in my first strides. Now, day passed as quickly into approaching night, but with the brightness of love, there is always light”. We thank you for sharing this time with us. May you and your loved ones age well.
